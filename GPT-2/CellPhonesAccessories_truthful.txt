I got the clear one but wish it was completely clear -- with no diamond shapes on it. It would be great if they had one option that purely let the beauty of the device shine through.

The case fits well and the ports are all accessible. The plastic around the headphone jack is rather close to that port, so I do wonder if some headphones might not fit correctly. However for the two headphones that I use I found no issue there. The lightning connector fit with no problem and buttons like volume up/down are easily pressed through the plastic.

There might be an issue if you want to use the wrist strap -- I don't use it so I don't know for certain how that would affect things. However the wrist strap ""button"" is accessible so it might not be a problem.

The case is flexible and somewhat rubbery. It has a nice tactile feel and definitely fixes the problem of feeling like you're going to let the iPod Touch slip out of your hands with there's no case on it.

Overall a nice case that should protect the iPod Touch 5 rather well.",Great case for the price,1350864000,14.0,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FVijtp9RL._SY88.jpg'],

I have dropped my phone numerous times on hard tile and it is none the worse for ware. It is also very thin for a case with a kickstand and the buttons work equally as well as the unprotected phone. The kickstand is a little flimsy, but it doesn't break when to much pressure is exerted on it. Rather, it simply over rotates and can be easily put back in place. Also, the case is easy to remove to change the battery.

I purchased the gel/plastic case with a kickstand as well and I hated it. It makes your phone three times as thick and is a nightmare to remove. It is now being recycled someplace because I threw it away.

4.0,True,2012-10-06,AOEH3OMQ5UIS5,B0077197N6,,Ailis,"I decided to wait a few weeks after receiving this item before I made my review based on the negative feedback that was left by previous people.  So here's my review:

I own a HTC Thunderbolt and have gone through 4 cases/clips since I first got my phone over a year ago.  In my profession, I wear a duty belt and having my phone on my side is an absolute necessity!  My job requires me to move around quite a bit, bending and flexing so on and so forth.  With all of the other cases/clips I've had, they've all broken in some capacity within a week (one was even the next day) after getting them.

Way back in the day when Nextel was the big thing, (I got suckered into their horrid service) I purchased a Rugged Brand case for my Nextel and had nothing but positive things to say about it.  So I've had experience with the brand and kinda knew what I was getting into when I purchased this case for my Thunderbolt.

When I first got the case for my thunderbolt, I experimented with using a silicone cover over my phone and putting my phone in the Rugged case.  The cover itself wasn't anything special, it was just a form fitting covering that covered the back and the sides of the phone.  When I put the phone with the silicone cover into the Rugged case, it was a bit snug but nothing that wasn't too much of a problem in removing the phone from the case to use.  I have decided that having the silicone cover on the phone and putting it in the Rugged case was a bit cumbersome so I have since removed the silicone case and have been putting my ""naked"" phone into the case.  With the ""naked"" phone in the case, it allows enough room for you to slide your fingers on either side of the phone (face and rear case) to be able to take the phone out of the case.

The magnet closure of the case does what it is supposed to.  To me, it feels strong enough to stay closed like it should and still allow for quick and easy access to get to my phone when needed.  The interior of the case itself is nice; it's soft, almost like a suede (but I know it's not).  There hasn't been any kind of ""residue"" left on my phone as some of the other reviewers have said was left on their phones.

The clip on the back of the case and the belt clip is the part that I have a love/hate relationship with.  The good part about it is that it's metal and I don't have to worry about some crummy plastic clip breaking on me at any given random moment causing my phone to fall to the floor, risking damage.  It's solid and its sturdy and that's what I've come to expect from the brand from past experience.  Now what I consider as the ""bad"" or the hate part of the relationship with this case/clip is that they have changed the design since I had their case when I had my Nextel.  When I had my Nextel, all you had to do to get the phone off of your belt was turn the case 90 degrees and pull up.  The metal part on the back of the case itself is totally different too.  The way I remember it was that it was in the shape of the letter ""D"" whereas now, it's completely circular.  Now, since it is circular, there is a metal tab on the belt clip portion that you have to push to release the phone from your belt.

Since my phone is a smartphone and a ""bar"" phone, they don't make cases specifically for my phone.  This case is a ""universal"" case therefore I don't have to remove the case from my belt every time I need to use it.  Now if the case was specially made for my phone, such as how the cases are for Nextel phones, I can see where this would be a hinderance.  It would be nice if they were like how they used to be, but its not that huge of a deal in my case.

Overall, I would rate the phone a 9 out of 10 simply because of the clip not being the way it used to be (as described above).  The case fits, it's functional and I don't have to worry about it breaking on me.  PLUS it's not as bulky as an Otterbox.",Durable and so far reliable,1349481600,2.0,,

4.0,True,2011-12-26,A2IYOX0G607ZKS,B004ECRMH4,,Ab Hat,"The PV300G is a pretty good phone, with a few minor flaws. First of all, the ""sidekick"" feature on the phone is great, and texting is very convenient and fast. This phone may be a different experience for some,however. It's not a touchscreen, and you have to use the little gray ball on the side of the phone to click things instead of your fingers. It would be a little faster if you could use your fingers, but for me, using the trackball wasn't too much of a problem. The main feature of this phone is texting, and the main menu has 2 menus for it. It's user friendly, except you can sometimes forget how to access the settings menu, which is the upper left button. All the basic settings are easy to operate and change, like the trackball speed, and sound profiles.

The only few cons in the phone is that you can't set a song as your ringtone. My ringtone on my previous phone was always ""Day Tripper"" by the Beatles. Here, it was hard to find out how to change the ringtone in the first place, unless you go through all the settings. Then, once you get to the ringtone menu in sound profiles, you have to choose from one of the weird ringtones that the phone has provided for you. I can't say that they're the best, and some of them are pretty bad. If you want a good ringtone, choose ""fatcat"".

The second con I have is the games and the internet connectivity. The default game that was stored on this phone for me was ""Bob's World, LAKE OF DOOM!!"". It's a pretty corny platformer game, with this ball just bouncing around the screen. I couldn't figure out the controls. I had ""Opera mini"" browser on this phone, and I couldn't connect to the internet very well. Also, you can't check your email.

In general, this is a pretty good phone. Best for people who love texting To sum it up:
Pros
good user friendliness
awesome texting features
organized/easy to operate settings

Cons
Bad choice of games
Bad ringtone selection
Can't check your e-mail,not so good internet connectivity
A few settings that you can't find without extra experimentation.

I have the Verizon Nexus with standard battery.  The Feather case is easy to put on and take off, an important consideration for anyone planning on using the Samsung OEM car dock and/or OEM desktop dock that utilize the charging pins on the right side of the phone.  The case is grippy as well and fits the phone perfectly.  It has wide open cutouts that allow direct access to the phone's volume and on/off buttons without interference.  The case wraps around the back and sides and edges of the phone but leaves the top and bottom edge exposed. While it doesn't cover the entire phone like the Incipio NGP, the trade off is that it is extremely light and adds very little to the phone's girth.

I've seen other reviews in which people complain that the Feather doesn't provide sufficient protection.  I guess these folks didn't bother to read the advertising first, or didn't pick up on the fact that the very name (""Feather"") implies light protection. This case is for people looking to enhance grip and protect the phone from scratches.  If you're a brick mason, a heavy machine operator or are just rough on your phones, get something else, like the Incipio Silicrylic.  I have also read elsewhere that some people felt the need to modify their cutouts, but this must have been for an earlier version of the Feather case than the one I have.  It needs no modification as the cutouts are well designed and large.

Another nice thing is that the Incipio Feather case comes with a high quality dry screen protector.

Things I like about it:
* good sound quality. I've used it when driving and could hear very well. There were no complaints on the other side too so I assume they could hear me well.
* comfortable. I use it with the ear piece and it fits well. You can keep it on while driving and it doesn't bother (almost...). I don't know if it's my ears that are different from all the rest of the world but the 'in ear' innovative ways to mount headsets just never work for me... I must have an ear piece that goes around the ear.
* affordable. I got this for the incredibly low price of around $15. I am not comfortable with spending $100 or even $50 for a BT headset no matter how nice its features are. The only thing I would pay more for is for excellent sound quality that can handle background noises and winds. I still haven't heard of a headset that does this perfectly so until there is one, I'll just look for ones that don't cost too much.
* easy pairing
* can be charged via USB so no need for a power socket (but can still be charged using a socket)
* dedicated power button
* battery and connection indicators

things that I think need to improve
* power button is very awkward placed.
* power/battery/connection indicators only light when the power button is pressed
* this is the most annoying thing: you need to press the power button for a few seconds to turn on/off. A sliding power switch with an on/off position would be best: it will be easy to use and will immediately indicate if the device is on or off. I think Jabra are using this for newer models

It's worth noting that integration with iPhone is different from my old headset. for example, i don't know how to direct music to the headset (but maybe you're not supposed to do this. I mean why would you listen to music on a one ear headset...). However, with this headset the phone still rings and most sounds are not directed to the headset until you actually start or answer a call, which i find very useful. with my old BT, all sounds were re-directed to the BT so you couldn't hear 'click' sounds when dialing or even message tones etc.","Affordable, comfortable with good sound quality, but has some design flaws",1328832000,2.0,,

2.  Here's the bottomline:
  a.  The price:  it's actually not that expensive, when you compare it to the typical plastic / rudimentary stand, which are basically throw away items.
  b.  Construction: top notch.  It's made out of some metal compound, the base is nice and solid / heavy, the rotating mechanism is solid... the entire unit is very well made.
  c.  Versatility:  top notch.  Because the method by which it holds the unit (ex: ipod or phone), it isn't hampered into fitting only one specific device.  Furthermore, the unit will rotate in all directions and it'll also move up and down.  Furthermore, because it holds the device via the sticky method, there are no issues in re: connecting headphone jacks, ac power cords etc... Again, complete versatility.
  d.  Question:  does this thing actually work?  Absolutely.  This was the most important question I had.  I've used various ""sticky"" type devices and found none of them that compelling.  This unit is really really really sticky, yet leaves zero residue.  Furthermore, what I can tell, this unit will continue to be sticky for a long time (basically:  after use, I just put the original plastic cover thing on top so that dust won't accumulate on the device.  You can periodically clean the item with a H20 /  cloth) and supposedly that will keep the unit functioning over time (I haven't had this product for a long time and thus can't comment on this issue... However, based on how sticky it is, I'm fairly confident that it will work over time).
3.  All in all, a very well made product, that provides the highest level of flexibility.  Highly recommended.
4.  FYI:  One reviewer made a very good point;  be sure to read the fine points--> specifically, IF you use a case for your ipod / phone, this may or may not work.

Regarding the button cutouts on this phone (which really aide in making buttons easier to press). The power button cutout is great. But it surprises me that there is no cutout for the volume rocker!?

The application process was very easy, compared to another protector I applied a few weeks ago that required soap water, that was kinda scary, and not easy.

Now, with these protectors, you just peel off one side, apply to the phone, and then peel off the remaining side and you're left with just the protector attached to the phone screen.  The cut out is very precise, and fit the mt4g very well.  There will be a millimeter gap to the edge of the screen, but that's a good thing, since if you get too close to any edge the protector doesn't want to stick very well (there's probably a curve there or something).I was most impressed with the bubble free installation.  There were practically no bubbles, and I didn't really have to do anything special.  I also had to reapply it because I didn't aim precisely the first time, and peeling off and reapplying was very easy.  Just stick the plastic tab you peeled off under the protector and lift it up.

PRO's:
- Easy to setup and pair;
- T325 downloads my contact list from my Blackberry and will verbally announce who is calling for all incoming calls (if the caller is NOT in my contact list, the T325 will verbally announce the phone number - a very convenient feature! Makes this item even more ""hands free""
- good speaker volume
- people I call say they cannot tell that I am on a portable bluetooth ""hands free"" system.

Minor Con's:
- T325 only comes with a car charger - one must buy the home AC charger cord separately (I ""upgraded"" from an older Motorola T305 which uses a standard USB Connector (which happened to be the same connector as my Blackberry) and of course that USB connector is incompatible with the T325 (T325 uses a MICRO USB connector) - I think its about time someone requires all cell phone devices to use one standard connector!!
- Periodically (once or twice a month), the T325 will inexpicably begin ""beeping"" for a second or two- on one occassion this lasted for close to 5 seconds (I'm assuming that interference from a nearby bluetooth device is causing this to occur);
- In the past 3 months of use, on 3 separate occassions, the T325 did NOT automatically ""pair"" with my phone as I entered my vehicle - No big deal, I just had to manually turn it on;
- Every time I get in the vehicle (even when I DON'T have my cell phone) like to clean out my car or when I'm working on it, the T325 will automatically Turn On - so I am assuming the T325 is triggered ON by a motion/close proximity sensor rather than sensing that the paired cell phone's bluetooth system is within 30 feet.

4.0,True,2011-04-06,A10WNL91TW447U,B001BF12QO,{'Color:': ' Black'},Phil Gagner,"For me, the device has worked almost exactly as advertised. I charge it, and I can use it to charge my iPhone. I can even charge it and my iPhone at the same time. Since everyone seems to be measuring their capacity experience, here's mine: If I fully charge the Satechi, I can get approximately two full charges on my iPhone 4 before I have to charge it again. By ""full charges,"" I mean I let my iPhone drop to between 10 and 20% power. After getting it back up to 100% (twice), I can only charge it once more to about 40-50%. Not as impressive as some people claim, but still a nice backup to have (I see some people say ""up to 4 times!"" -- maybe they are only charging it from 40 or 50% up to a full charge? Who knows.)

The one nag I have is the lights on the device. It seems to be extremely inconsistent in signifying how much power it has left. I can leave it plugged in for 24 hours and it almost never lights completely up. It has 5 little lights and in the 3 months I've had it, I think I've seen all 5 lights on maybe twice, and as soon as I unplug it from the charge, the indicator is back down to four lights. It's hard to tell if/when it is ever fully charged, so I just generally leave it plugged in overnight (6-8 hours) and assume it's fully charged in the morning. I'll use it to charge my phone a couple of times, and it still has three lights, so I feel confident it still has plenty of charge. Then I try to charge my phone again, and it dies right away. I have very little confidence in the indicator lights actually giving an accurate depiction of how much power the device has left, so I just have to make sure I keep a mental note of how much I've used it since I last charged it.

I'm seeing now that there are some reviews saying that people have called Satechi and are being told that the recommended method to charge it is to use a USB port. This is ridiculous and if this is the case, I would never have purchased this particular device (there are plenty of others to choose from). One of the main reasons I bought this is so that I could take it with me when I travel and I know I will always have power for my phone. You're saying I'm going to have to make sure I travel with my computer, too? I'm not always going to have a computer with me (gasp) when I travel -- isn't that part of the reason for iPhones and iPads, so people don't have to travel with a laptop? Plus, charging via USB is considerably slower than charging from a direct outlet (even their crappy documentation states this).

Pros:
o Construction quality is great - very well put together and ""feels"" expensive
o Provides me at least two ""full"" charges on my iPhone 4
o Carrying pouch so you can carry it and a cable or two around
o It doesn't have to be rigidly connected to my device in order to charge it (some devices connect directly to your phone to charge it, making using your phone a little cumbersome and inconvenient; with this, you use your original charging cable and have a lot more freedom)
o It will charge just about ANY device that is charged via USB (iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, Droid, etc)

Cons:
o Capacity lights don't seem to reliably indicate how much charge remains on the device
o (arguable con) - if it's true that they prefer you use USB to charge this rather than a power outlet, that should be stated in the documentation; this would have been a dealbreaker for me",Good charger with some quirks,1302048000,3.0,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ewZbdy9yL._SY88.jpg'],
4.0,True,2011-01-25,A3EZEP0FX5BC1P,B0027FFZEW,,A Conrad,"I purchased this unit when the price dropped below $50.  I wanted to compare this to my other bluetooth (BT) headset, which is the Jawbone PRIME Bluetooth Headset Ear Candy Edition (Drop Me a Lime Green).  I owned the PRIME before buying this PRO, and having used both units I can honestly say IMHO that although the Jawbone PRIME has a better sound quality (just BARELY and ever so slightly better), this Voyager PRO does the job just as well.  The bottom line is that the Plantronics Voyager PRO is an excellent bluetooth headset.  I alternate between this Voyager PRO and the Jawbone PRIME, using one while the other charges.

Let me first describe everything that is great about it:

- One of the best sound quality of all the BT headsets I've used (and I've gone through plenty), second only to the Jawbone Prime.  I heard the person on the other end very clearly, and I was clear to the other person as well.  No complaints from the other caller when I used this BT headset, unlike when I used the Motorola H500 or the Plantronics Explorer 220 where my voice was cut-off about 25% of the time.
- Very loud (or loud enough).  I've set my phone's earpiece volume to MED using this Voyager PRO BT unit.
- One of the best noise cancellation technology IMHO.  I am utterly amazed with how well the dual-mic technology works.  It works with low-to-moderate background noise when you are in a car, in a store, in starbucks, etc.
- Easily switch from one ear to the other by rotating the earpiece.
- It is lightweight and compact, though it loses out to the Jawbone Prime on this category.  Having said that, I have not lost this headset once, whereas I've lost the Prime several times due to its compactness.
- Very easy to put on, and once it is on its stays on.  This feature is what edges out the Prime.  With the Prime, it takes a a while to figure out the proper configuration to get it to stay in your ear.  With the Voyager Pro, just loop around the ear, move the mic boom, and it will stay on.  I've jogged a 5K race with this on... just to prove to my friends that it will stay put (and it did!).
- It is very easy to pair with my phones.
- The battery life is excellent/very good.  I can go through the whole day of moderate use (about 4 hours of talk time) with a single overnight charge.  I've gone two days without recharging.  I won't dare go three, but seeing how cheap these units are now, maybe I'll get another unit.
- MicroUSB interface means that I can use my cell phone charger to charge this (and vice-versa).
- Fast power-up and connect.  I keep this unit off while I wear it, and when I get a call, I turn it on and it can connect between the second and third ring.

Now, the negatives:

- At first, I was used to the sound clarity of the Jawbone PRIME, so this Voyager PRO sounded a bit tinny to my ears.  However, after finding the proper ear gel that fits me, the sound clarity is now just as good as the Jawbone PRIME.
- It is larger and bulkier than the Jawbone PRIME.  However, it is not as big as its predecessor (Voyager).  I wish this unit had a charging base like the Voyager.
- There is no battery indicator that tells me how much charge is left.  I understand that the Voyager PRO+ has a feature where if paired with an iPhone the iPhone will display the charge capacity of this BT headset.

Obviously, there is still room for improvement.  If the Voyager PRO+ works just as well as this PRO unit, and if it has the charger indicator for a Blackberry (or any other phone), I may have to rank it higher.  For now, this unit deserves a 4.5 star rating (rounded down).  It's almost perfect.

IMHO I will have to state that the current price (under $50) and the features and quality of the Plantronics Voyager Pro makes it one of the best BT headsets I've ever used.  This is, of course, highly subjective, and there may be other better bluetooth headsets that I have not tried.  I highly recommend the Voyager PRO.",Excellent BT headset!

I found it quite difficult to get a satisfying car mount for my iphone 4. There are some that work fine w/o a case, but non specifically set to work with an apple bumper, as I have. So I went universal, and there is a wide range in quality out there. After a couple of intensive days of research, I settled on this Arkon. It is pretty unobtrusive, seems quite secure, and does exactly what it is supposed to do with no fuss. My only real complaint is the encircling arms, but they are nearly inevitable with a universal mount.

as I said, I am currently using a clingo vent mount, and am quite satisfied (after only 2 days, so we will see).

This screen is a pretty good qualit replacement screen. I got it through the Zehai vendor.
Construction of the screen overall is good. Brackets are not flimsy and the frame isn't super delicately attached. Color of the screen isn't weird bluish or anything like some others have complained in reviews for other screens.

Ribbons for the LCD and digitizer are the correct length, just make sure to pull them all the way through and don't tug them.

My package did come with a small tool kit, however, neither were a magnet one, which you really need.
You will need a small magnetic Phillips head, a small flat head and the star driver. As well as the pry tool(s). If you search for an iPhone4 tool kit, the one that pops up and shows the little set is all you really need. All the pry bars are garbage and only seem to be good for one or two usages, but whatever.

A few things to note- the battery is REALLY friggen hard to get out. I suggest using the pry bar on the right hand side. That's how I finally got it out.

Android system is getting better by leaps and bounds. I have a machine shop so I needed protection for the Razr and I had the Otter Box defender on my 3GS. The case is great and protects the phone very well. Unfortunately it had the same bad holster design I had on the IPhone. The reason is the phone ends up on the floor trying to ungrip it from the holster! You have to pry it away and off the 4 bumps in the plastic holster that grip the 4 depressions on the case. And forget about grabbing the phone and separating it from the holster with your free hand. It's 50/50 whether you'll hang on to it or it will just shoot out of the holster onto the floor.

The down side is the Seidio has a fragile belt clip that will break say if you sit down in a car and its vertical. Any outward push with enough force and its gone. I am ordering a Seidio active case holster combo and hope the holster will also work with my Otter Box defender case. I'll have to watch the belt clip problem and keep my receipt incase it breaks. Seidio has a warranty of sorts I believe.","Case OK, Holster sucks",1331769600,7.0,,

Johnson,"I read the reviews before I bought this product so I had an expectation that in my environment it would work correctly....and it did.  It's important that you can find a signal sweet spot...most likely outside of your house...that is within 30 to 50 feet of the area where you want to boost your signal.  For technical reasons you need a separation between where the receiving antenna is located and where you want to place the associated amplifier.  I was told by the tech dept you can locate the receiving antenna further than 50 feet away but there is a cost signal wise that is about 7db...appox 1 bar on most phones... for each 100 feet.  In my case the cable length needed to be 62 feet (I had to put a 12 foot extension on the 50 feet supplied) to allow my receiving antenna to be in the best sweet spot I could find on my property.  The sweet spot was a location that was between -82db and -85db which is about 4 bars on most cell phones.  The line of sight is about 30 feet away from my inside problem area but in order to run the cables I needed about 62 total feet of cable.  The end result was that although my cable needed to be longer...the signal strength at my sweet spot was way more than enough to offset the extra cable length signal loss.  The bottom line is I have a wonderful signal where I used to not be able to talk inside my house.  I placed the inside amp box near where I previously had no signal.  I recommend this product to those who have a sweet spot they want to ""move"" inside.  If you do not have enough signal anywhere then do not buy this product.  This product simply allows one to move the best signal to a new location...but that location has to be within a reasonable distance away.  One more note...it is very important to take a lot of time to find the best sweet spot you can find.  Most cell phones can be put in a mode where you can see the signal strength in decibels rather than bars....the lower the decibel number the better.  You need to know that it takes most cell phones 15 seconds or more to update those numbers so finding the absolute best sweet spot is not always fast.  Sometimes 1 foot movement can make a huge difference signal wise so take your time to locate where your receiving antenna should be mounted.  Also it helps to know where your cell phone transmitting tower is and point the receiving antenna towards that tower.  This might be a problem for some consumers to find but if you do know the direction of your cell phone company's tower you can fine tune signal reception in a fringe area.  I suspect that if you find a sweet spot of 4 bars or more the actual location of the tower will not be a huge problem but it certainly will help.  None of this is hard to do and it really makes a difference between getting a fantastic signal inside to just a marginal one.  The 30 day guarantee is great for those who cannot make this product work in their location.  Well worth the money.",very happy with this product,1279843200,2.0,,

This came close per the specs on the niteize website (NiteIze calls this the Size 10 model and says its External Dimensions are 4.5"" x 2.75"" x 1.5""), however the curve of the bottom really reduces its volume and I guess I really do want the 2"" depth of my previous NiteIze case.

I knocked a star off since my original post a couple weeks ago.

This screen gets very dirty quickly and I keep my hands clean.  Maybe I rubbed off the oleophobic coating that prevents fingerprints.  It is also very difficult to clean unless you are using a microfiber cloth. Using my shirt just makes things worse.

Also, this protector has many small scratches already.  I keep this thing holstered with the screen facing in.  I don't keep it in my pocket.  End of update.

I admit this review is short sighted.  I just received this oleophobic product in the pink package about 1/2 an hour ago so I only gave it 4 stars out of five for now.  I simply cleaned the screen off  really well with the included microfiber fabric swatch and did the installation in my kitchen on the countertop with the lights  on full bright.  Of course the phone was off or it would have been very difficult to apply this bubble free with the screen backlight on.

I have a white note 2 so I don't know if that made it easier or more  difficult to apply the product.

I will say the product went on without a single bubble.  Not even a nano, microscopic bubble is seen at this point. I have put wet protectors on before but this is my first time with a dry applied protector.  It was very easy to put on.

The one thing I did was to leave the thin protective film on the front of the screen protector until completely done.  I believe the instructions say to remove it before applying.  This thin plastic on the front protects the actual protector while you are using the plastic squeegee and this avoids scratching the protector while pushing out any bubble and making sure the protector is firmly adhered to the phone glass.

As stated on the package.  This protector is slightly smaller than the phone to compensate for the curved glass edges of the phone.  It doesn't look bad at all on my phone. I got lucky and pretty much got it perfectly aligned right away with good even spacing on both sides.  I will say the the width of the protector is more than enough to cover the active screen portion so there will be no edges of the protector obscuring your view of this great looking display.

I also have a Seidio active case attached.  The protector slightly goes under a small portion of one corner  of this case.  I don't anticipate any problems with the case lifting up the edge of the screen protector but it could happen.  If it does, I will trim the protector

I am really impressed by the clarity of this protector. I can't see any clarity issues at all.  The spen works great and doesn't leave any imprints on the protector when writing.  The hover feature of the spen works with the same sensitivity as before and so does the touch screen sensitity.

The surface is nice and slick.  I can't tell if it is the same as before or not but  it is certainly nice and smooth to glide a finger over.

The protector is shiny just like the glass.  This is not a matte finish as some other protectors are.  This of course does cause reflections but it also allows bright, rich colors to show through unlike some matte finish protectors I have used in the past.  The reflections are no different than the original glass.  This has never bothered me though like it bothers some other people.

This thing does show some fingerprints but it is in no way a fingerprint magnet.  I noticed that my Note 2 at first, did not show fingerprints very much but lately it has been showing them much more. I have only had it a few weeks.  It could just be my imagination.  I believe the gorilla glass 2 that is on the note is supposed to have an oleophobic coating like the protector to help resist fingerprints.

I was a little intoxicated when I ordered these screen protectors and I ordered two other brands as well that have not shown up.  I wasn't sure which ones I would like.  I am certainly not going to take this one off for no reason just to test the others

I will update this if I am able to and any problems pop up.

My last phone was the Samsung Galaxy skyrocket and I did not have a screen protector on that with its original Gorilla Glass.  I always holstered it with the face side in.  It had a couple very minor scratches.  However, this note screen is so large that more things are probably going to be coming in contact with the screen and I may put this in my pocket on occasion.

This is an expensive phone and I work in a factory building airplanes  so that is why I have the case, screen protector and insurance.  It is also bigger with more surface area to hit the ground when it falls and it weighs more than other phones so that will increase the force when it hits the ground.  I usually get the insurance for the first year.  I have left a phone at the airport.  I have broke screens a few times when  they have fell at work.

There are many stories already over at XDA developers about this phone dropping from only a few feet and getting a cracked screen. The glass goes right to the edge on this phone with no lip to protect it, so yeah, cover this beauty up with a case and get the protector",so far so good,1354838400,2.0,,

1- This case have a much more thicker layer of silicon, the last version of it was less tick and more soft to the touch this one is a bit hard which in my opinion protects better the phone and gives you more grip.
2- The plastic layer looks a bit off compare to the older version even tho its not noticeable if you don't have both cases the older version was build more precisely.
3- I'll upload some picture where will see that the silicon doesn't sealed perfectly on two of the edges but is nothing that will let dust go inside the case in the other hands the rest of the silicon fits more firm on the rest of the case.
4- If you think there is not really a different between the old version and this one i should say i see my light sensor working more often than it used to before thank to the open design with this new version.
5- The vibration switch is now more accessible and the camera and the led is open more which will never give you any problem related to picture quality but its deep enough not to hit when it fall.
6- The protection is incomparable like all otterbox product i tested in lots of surface at max 7 foot high and either the phone or the case suffer any damage or scratch.
7- About the seller shipped me this item in 3 days and one night when it was a 5-8 days ship method very good I'm very happy, also they didn't left the box at my door like some other shipping companies do.

conclusion
I feel better with this case because it feels more safe thanks to the ticker silicon, it also is design for the new 4s which let you switch better the vibration/silence switch also have an open design for the front facing camera and the light sensor making them work properly the same with the rear camera and the led flash, and what makes this deal better is the seller with very fast shipping good shipping company and excellent price.",Goods and bads at least this one,1322352000,18.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aKF1UGpzL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SoPdRD6lL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WMd86y-AL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fSWfBwk3L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41l-1RuRV3L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mUEASCBaL._SY88.jpg']",

I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.

Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.

Here's my report of each adapter:

Black adapter received from seller ""Eforcity"" - 3 stars:
This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn't buy another one.

Black adapter received from seller ""Elago Design"" - 5 stars:
First of all, the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn't say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head, but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.

This seller also sells a black one on this listing. I would think it's the same quality as the white one they sell.

I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.

If you order this or any other item and don't receive what was pictured and listed, contact the seller.

5.0,True,2011-06-01,ABDR6IJ93HFIO,B003N17IJ4,,Daisy S,"This is my FIRST REGULAR ANDROID phone(other than ViewPad7 by Viewsonic). And before this, I had a HTC HD2 with Windows 6.5 (it was too buggy) and decided to go to an Unlocked HTC Android Phone. Since I am a huge HTC Fan (have been since HTC Excilabar-Dash). That said, this is how I gave a rating of 4.95:

1) Fast - goes into programs, apps very fast. 5 stars
2) WiFi - No problem QUICKLY hooking up to WiFi anywhere (at home or on the road). 5 stars
3) Good basic Music Player - I love to play music and audio files and this does the job nicely. 4.8 stars
4) FM Radio - Easy to use and wonderful sound. 5 stars
5) Easy to use menus - I learned this phone within 1 hour without referring to the manual!
6) Added bonus--After I installed apps to my phone, I wanted to move them to my SD card. I downloaded the FREE APP called SUPERBOX from the Android Market (it is free and has 10 superb utilities including: Move to SD Card, UNINSTALL, File Manager, Task Killer, Battery Info, System Info, Memory Manager and more). Because of this program SUPERBOX, I was able to move my apps from phone memory to the SD Card! Android 2.2 and higher ASKS you at the time of each APP download if you want it on the SD Card or on the phone. Android 2.1 by default places the app on the phone. However, now that I have SUPERBOX, I have moved my APPS to my SD Card (after I installed them on phone). Note that Android prior to 2.1, you cannot move APPS to SD Card. (One of the reasons that I bought this phone it has 2.1).

CONS (however, these can be ""fixed"")
1) No File Manager! Minus 1/2 star! To fix this I went to the Android Market App and searched for FILE MANAGER, I found one I liked and installed and it is free and works great!
2) Needed better Music Manager to move songs around in my playlists. Again Android Market App to the rescue, downloaded a Music Player FREE that I like and am so so happy that I can move songs around in my playlists.
3) Poor TASK Manager! So back I go to the wonderful Android Market App Store! Yes, there I found a TASK Manager program FREE called SUPERBOX that has an Task/Memory Manager and a TASK KILLER and it frees memory so quickly--keeps this phone running smoothly and fast, fast fast!!!!
4) MMS/INTERNET Settings: WiFi works right out of the box, however, as in ANY unlocked phone, you need to get the MMS/Internet settings from ATT or T-Mobile or whatever your carrier is. In my case, I am a ATT Customer and paid pre-paid for $25 worth of data and wanted to try this out in a non WiFi area. It did not work. So I placed the APN settings in myself and opps, they still did not work! Now I am somewhat of a techie so I knew most in the APN settings were inserted by me OK, but something was missing as I could not go on ATT Internet or MMS! Every phone accepts APN settings differently. So I called ATT and had to sweet talk them for about an hour because I am a pre-paid customer. Finally after I insisted for about one hour, the support person sent me to the post-paid department and the tech there simply SYNCED the settings to my phone and in just 5 minutes, I had data (internet) and MMS! I was so blessed in this because ATT does not like UNLOCKED non ATT phones, nor do they like to deal with Pre-Paid customers. However, I explained to them that I paid $25 for the LARGEST Monthly Data Pre-Paid Plan (ATT offers $5,$15, $25 good for 30 days)and I was very upset because I could not use my data, and when the ATT Rep heard this he was very helpful and this is why I was able to speak to the ""higher end"" Post Paid tech who within 5 minutes synced my phone with proper settings for both the MMS and Internet Data , both have worked rigtht then and have ever since! I mostly use WiFi at home and on the road, however, about 15% of the time, I need to get on the Internet in a location that does not have WiFi this is when I use my ATT Data. If you ONLY use WiFi and don't plan to use a pre-paid data plan as I do, then you will not need these settings from the carrier unless you MMS (send pictures or receive pictures).

*I hope this helps you the person thinking of buying this phone or any unlocked phone as maybe my experience with this will assist you in making up your mind. As far as this phone is concerned, it is a wonderful phone for a beginner to smartphones, android phones and even wonderful for the more advanced person. This phone has gone BEYOND my expectations! And being an HTC/ANDROID phone icing on the cake! If anyone would like to comment or ask a question, I will answer. Hope that you have enjoyed my review.

**Update August 16, 2011: Just checked the software OS and it showed 2.2.1 Android! At the time that I purchased this phone in May, 2011, I assumed that it had 2.1 Android OS. However, since I have been using the phone, I get on the internet often and notice that the phone automatically updates my APPS and programs (I set it up to do this). This is why I believe that the phone possibly updated to Android 2.2 Froyo since I just checked and it has Android 2.2.1! I do not think that this phone is upgradable to Android 2.3 Gingerbread. However I did a search on my computer and found that in the Android Marketplace there are apps for Gingerbread theme and other OS themes. Since I love the theme I have now, I am going to keep my 2.2 true to form and when I buy future Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) or 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) future phones, the themes will be real!

For basic cell phone usage, the phone does work.  I have been able to use it overseas and in the U.S. as a basic cell phone without any problem.  Where the phone fails though is as a smartphone.

Bootup is excruciatingly slow.  It takes so long for anything to appear on the screen that I often (needlessly) press and hold the power button because I'm never sure that I actually turned the phone on.

The phone also randomly reboots itself.  I've had it reboot during websurfing.  I've had it reboot while checking the Ovi application store.  It randomly reboots when listening to MP3 songs.  It reboots when looking at text messages.  Every reboot is annoying, and it's made worse by the slow bootup (see previous paragraph).

The Ovi application store is a joke.  First, there's hardly any applications there compared to Android or Apple.  And when using the Ovi store application from the phone, it's impossible to tell if the application is truly compatible with the Symbian 3 operating system used by this phone.  It is entirely possible to download a non-compatible application, unless you carefully read all the reviews to find someone who downloaded the app and has this same phone.

I could live with that, except that the screen isn't responsive, so I find myself tapping the screen and nothing happening to get to the review link...and the same thing is true for web pages, icons, etc.  The phone is slow and often unresponsive to touches.

Installation of apps...requires a reboot.  At least I think it require a reboot, because everytime I install an app, the phone reboots.

Bottom-line:  I happen to use and/or own an Android phone and a Blackberry phone, as well as previously owning Palm phones.  All of those phones are more responsive, have better applications, and better operating systems.  This phone is only good for being able to carry around the world and make a phone call.

I want a thin profile that doesn't bulk up the phone; I'm looking mostly for scratch protection, not drop protection. This case is a perfect fit for that need, and it feels solid enough to also provide basic drop protection as well..

The plastic is firm and smooth, but with a slightly velvety finish.  This isn't a coating on the plastic, but a function of the plastic itself, which means the texture and color won't rub off. It snaps firmly into place and protects back, sides, and corners. It is very slightly raised above the front surface, so it will provide screen protection for those who like to lay their phones face down. Top and bottom edges are open beyond the corners, but (as with the front) a very slight raised edge to the case to further protect those surfaces.

The finish on this case is also much better than some I have owned. All edges are nicely smooth, all cutouts are clean and provide excellent access to buttons and openings, and the cutout around the camera lens is large enough to prevent any interference.  Finally, the color is just what you would expect.  A true deep denim navy blue that blends into the black anodized aluminum trim on the new iPhone.

I tested A LOT of cases for my iPhone 4S, especially looking for one that doesn't interfere with any type of screen protector I have. I finally found it. the Magpul Field Case (Made in the USA!!) is exceptional. The texture is perfect, ribbed back provides grip, and the remaining case is texturized to help, but not too grippy for pulling it in and out of my pocket with ease. This case replaces my OtterBox Commuter, which also was a great case, but I found that the silicone inner lining that wraps around the screen edge became ""soft"" after a while and didn't keep it;s stiff shape. Because of this, it kept picking up the edges of my screen protector. Also the rubber flaps that cover the data and headphone ports because annoying after a while.

This case doesn't have the port flaps (good or bad, whichever you prefer) and the case is firm, yet easy to take the phone in and out. AND most importantly to me, it doesn't interfere with my NakedShield screen protector because the case is molded to ""grab"" onto the outer metal ring built in to the phone and it doesn't actually touch the glass screen at all. Plus, the Field Case protrudes HIGHER than the glass surface a bit so you don't have to worry about placing the phone screen down. It is my understanding that the Magpul Executive case offers a more flush surface with the glass screen and edge of the case, although I have not seen it in person.

Being former military, I really like my OD Green color I ordered for my black iPhone 4S, and the material and product is just as exceptional as the Magpul products I used in Iraq. Now in law enforcement, I am not worried whatsoever about my phone I carry in my shirt pocket and the times that I drop it. I have used it for about two weeks now and have zero complaints. All of my third party headphone jacks plug in nicely, but I do need to use a data port extender when I put my phone (in the case) on my Vizio iPhone/iPod stereo because the case is too thick for the phone to sit all the way down on the built in data port connector on the stereo.

I was able to activate the phone within 10 minutes. Instructions provided by the seller were perfect - just be sure to read the instructions that are taped to the outside of the Tracfone package. Problems with activation and phone setup by others are caused by not reading and following the instructions. Follow these instructions step by step and the process is simple. Step#1 - Plug the phone into the charger and activate the phone with the Tracfone Red Activation Card. I had to wait a few minutes for my phone to be activated and get my new phone number. Do not go on to step#2, adding airtime, until your phone is activated. Step#2 - You need to add airtime using the 15 digit PIN number that is in the instructions that were taped to the phone package. When I tried to add the 50 bonus minutes for Sept. from the TracFone Saving Book it wouldn't take it. After activation and adding my 1200 minutes I called Tracfone and they gave me 50 minutes when I gave them the code from the TracFone Saving Book. I ended up with a bonus of 50, so I got 1200+50+20 that came with the phone, for a total of 1270 minutes.

Wow, I got the LG800g with one year of service and 1200 minutes, all for $109. The price of the LG800g bought separately ($49), plus the cost of one year of service and only double minutes ($99) equals almost $150. So for only $109 you get the phone, one year of service, TRIPLE minutes for life, and a great phone. This is by far the best Tracfone ever offered, and I've had a lot of them over the years.

Picked up the 3X screen protectors, and picked up a newly offered gel case for the LG800g at E-v-o-l-u-c-e-l-l (take the dashes out and do a google search for it) for less than $10.

The Zagg shield seems to be the most trusted product on the market for this purpose. Do the searches and read trusted source reviews. {LOL, you still reading]  None of the other cheap films compare - lifetime replacement or not! And don't buy that, ""This other film is smoother,"" stuff - wash the PB&J off your hands, they work the same.

My story:
Received the product. (Key point here!) Read the instructions. Installed the 2 piece - front and rear glass protectors - in less than 10 minutes, going slow and careful at that.
*Tips for a perfect installation:
- Wash your hands
- Clean area you are applying the film (ie screen, back side) and use a lint free wipe
- Keep your fingers WET anytime you touch the film (prevents fingerprints setting and film sticking to hands)
- Wet both sides of the film. When it's wet, you can easily adjust positioning before setting, and if you blow it, re-wet and re-apply, no worries.
- When film is laid down as you like it, use the squeegee tool included to work water out from underneath the film from the CENTER to the edges

If you do these things, installation really isn't the impossible monster everyone makes it out to be. The film, when dry and set, is barely noticeable save for the slight tactile change to the slick glass. I have no trouble using the touch screen on the device, and if applied to the rear glass, the film will keep the phone from sliding across the (insert surface). It will also save the glass from the scratches that will accompany that slide should you wish to use it as an advantage puck on a sandy, barroom shuffleboard table.

Of course there's always a smoother or thinner film you can play, ""please send me another TYVM,"" with the manufacturer. GG",No whining here...,1278633600,2.0,,

I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.

Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.

Here's my report of each adapter:

Black adapter received from seller ""Eforcity"" - 3 stars:
This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn't buy another one.

Black adapter received from seller ""Elago Design"" - 5 stars:
First of all, the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn't say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head, but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.

The cord feels flimsy. The plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery. From my own experience with iPhone cases made of similar material, I suspect this cord with discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning if it doesn't break before that. This seller also sells a black one on this listing. I would think it's the same quality as the white one they sell.

I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.

If you order this or any other item and don't receive what was pictured and listed, contact the seller.

It does exactly as promised, reliably charging all manner of devices from iPhones to iPads (simultaneously) and of course non-Apple products as well.  Included in the package is a relatively short pigtail cord with standard USB on one end and mini/micro USB adapters on the other.  Be aware that a wall transformer is not included in the package -- your existing Apple mini-cube transformer or other USB power source will do the trick.  One feature this newer model has that the older ones apparently do not have is a smart sensing (power saving) capability which turns off the battery pack once your device is fully charged.  Interestingly, the IMP70D does not get hot when charging (or discharging), likely a sign of good power and thermal regulation, which should lead to a longer service life.

Also, the apps all have advertisements on the menu screen (which is very easy for her to get to while trying to play her game), so if her little fingers hit those ads, safari now opens and takes her away from her apps.

The phone reported that it was charging, but the battery levels just kept dropping.  I let it sit for a little while, then hooked it up to my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Galaxy-4-0-Android-MP3-Player/dp/B005P1VMLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Galaxy 4.0 Android MP3 Player</a>&nbsp;with the latter at 10% charge.  The charger performed flawlessly, and later on charged my Nexus just fine.  Read on for the details.

PROS
+ Nice, solid design.  While it's built from light plastics, there's no creaking or flex in the chassis.  It's also small enough to fit easily into most bags, and even some medium-sized pockets.  While you'll have to deal with the cable, the included adapters mean that at least you'll only need to bring one.
+ Great capacity for the price.  Even if you never use the panel, you've got enough juice in here to fully recharge your depleted phone, and then some besides.  While I don't believe the true capacity is 4,000mAh (see cons and another review on here), it's not bad for a cheap charger.
+ The solar panel is a nice touch.  While it doesn't charge that quickly, it's useful on long drives or just letting it passive charge while not in use.  The light indicators make it pretty clear when you're in enough sunlight to charge, although they provide little information as to how fast the battery is filling up.
+ The panel actually will charge in some office lighting, just don't expect it to be fast.

CONS
- As noted in another review, I sincerely doubt that this backup sports a 4,000mAh cell.  My CDMA Galaxy Nexus has a battery capacity of 1,850mAh, and the status lights reported that the device was half full (give or take) after charging about 80% of the Nexus' battery.  I'm pretty sure it's a little less than 4,000mAh.
- The documentation is not terrible, but it's not helpful either.  The important thing to remember is that the battery will not charge your device unless you turn it on.  When you hold down the silver button for about three seconds or so, you should see the four status lights come on (or however many come on, depending on how much power you have left).  At that point, your device will begin to charge.  Once you're done (or if your device is full), hit the button again to switch it off.  Once your battery's charged, the backup battery will turn off.
- The solar panel will not charge the battery very quickly.  You can use it to trickle charge your device, but be aware that it is a losing battle.  I think I read somewhere that in ideal conditions, this panel will charge at a rate approaching 250mAh/hr, which would mean 16 hours of perfect sunlight to fully charge the cell.  That's never going to happen unless you live on the equator.  Think of the solar panel less as a way to charge the backup so much as a supplement.

On the whole, this is a good purchase, but have no illusions about how fast the panel will charge!",A solid charger that happens to have a solar panel on it.,1343606400,2.0,,

I have the white iphone 4S for AT&T, and the case fits both. I was a little worried when I ordered it because one review said the headphone jack hole was in the wrong place and that it actually isn't for the 4S after all. That is not true.

There is a hole at the top of the case - for the microphone. The headphone jack is appropriately covered with a flap to avoid introducing dust and debris into the hole when it is not in use. All of the other holes, buttons, flaps, etc line up as you would expect. The buttons can be pressed easily through the raised portions of the case and the flaps can be opened and closed without issue, once you learn where they all are. = )

The description and picture don't really do the case justice. The blue plastic is not quite as dark as in the picture. It is about a midnight blue, but not navy. It looks great with a black iphone, but I didn't like it as much with my white one. Please note, however, that the opening about the back camera/flash has BLACK plastic and not blue. This may be to avoid reflective issues with the flash, and does not detract from the case in any way.

The case is solidly constructed and pieced together in such a manner than none of the pieces could accidentally come apart without either major breakage or purposeful intent.

The screen has a built in screen protector, which works well even with the second one I have underneath it (yes, I am paranoid and clumsy). The back hole exposing the apple logo also has a plastic protector. The only places the phone is even remotely exposed when all flaps are in place are: around the bottom speakers, the top microphone, the front speaker/sensor/camera area and the back camera/flash area. The exposed areas are as minimal as necessary and do not make me feel that the case would not fully protect the phone.

The case is slightly grippy and does not slip easily, but does not appear to attract lint easily, either. The screen does not have an overly plasticy feel and wipes clean easily. Although the clear film could be scratched, it would not be done so with incredible ease.

The case does add bulk to the phone. There is no getting around that. I do not find the bulk to be prohibitive, but I almost never carry my phone in my pocket. I'm not an engineer, builder or mathematician, but I would say it increases the size by about 25-30%. This is not a lot when you stick the phone in a bag or purse, but might make a difference if sticking it in a pocket. The phone also come with a black belt clip. The belt clip adds somewhat more bulk, but the phone can be placed inside with the screen pointed in or out, depending on if you value protection or convenience. The clip on the belt clip also rotates so that you can wear the phone vertically or horizontally, depending on your preference.

Please note that some descriptions say the case is felt lined. That is not true. It has a pad inside that covers about 75% of the back plastic - most likely to help cushion the phone, stop the case from scratching the phone, and to help with heat distribution. But the case is not lined in any way on the inside.

Last, but not least, there were some reviews (for other colors) that state one of two things are detractors: 1) That the case causes sound irregularities, such as lower volume or echoing OR 2) That the case interferes with the camera and/or flash. Well, I don't know what other people are doing, but I do not find either of those statements to be true. I tested both the earphone and speakerphone with and without the case and found no issues. I also took pics with both the front and rear camera before and after placing the case and found no issues there either.

So far, I really like the case. If any issues arise, I will be sure to post them and adjust my rating as necessary.

UPDATE: Otterbox has started using a new rubber for the outer portion of the case. The case I purchased was the old type of rubber. It was much stretchier and stretched out to the point of being unusable. I contacted Otter Box and because I was within 1 year of purchase, they replaced it immediately. It was a simple process and I am impressed with their customer service. The new case has a much stiffer rubber that doesn't seem to want to stretch out nearly as much. Also, the case I bought for my personal phone (the same case in another color combination) has barely stretched at all after a year of heavy use. It has the stiffer rubber on it as well. Overall, it is a good case, and even though the older version stretched out, I am keeping it a 5 star review because of how well Otterbox's customer service took care of the issue.",Great case for the iphone 4S (Verizon OR AT&T),1327449600,11.0,,

The first two required power input using a micro usb charger (same one your phone uses) and ports on both of them broke after 1-2 uses (haven't reviewed them yet, but gonna rip 'em a new one). One great thing about this one is that issue doesn't exist. The cable length is an awesome perk. It's 6.5 feets (not a typo; buy it and you'll see). The video quality looks really good watching hi-def movies on a 60"" 1080P TV.

So yeah, it does all I think it's designed to do, but I deducted a star for a couple reasons.

Last night my phone died in the middle of a movie. So although the phone indicates that it is charging, it really isn't. The power is only enough for the adapter, so put your phone in Airplane Mode to reduce battery usage. I did use it to charge my phone while the HDMI was unplugged, but it charged very slowly. I guess it is not designed to power both itself and the phone, but one of those lousy ones I mentioned earlier charged my phone while in use, so I know it can be done. I'm hoping maybe there is a movie player app that allows you to turn off the phone screen while connected to a TV. If so, this would be a non-issue.

Before that, I dropped it a couple of feet onto a thin carpet and the housing popped apart, leaving all the cords and various connections to the little circuit board totally exposed. Bad glue job it seems. I put it back together and used a small zip tied to hold it in place and it works fine. I'm sure a couple drops of super glue would be a permanent solution, but I can see less resourceful people freaking out about that.

All in all, I like this one the best, although it's only after 3-4 uses. The inconceivably low price makes this choice a total no-brainer. I'll probably buy another for my other TV.

***UPDATE 3/25/13***
So the guy who commented about my tolerance of the poor quality construction of this thing was right. This thing eventually broke apart again and now it's destroyed. Also, even when it was working, it would significantly drain my phone's battery, no matter what charger I used. The other types, at worst, will keep your battery level where it is. I put my phone in Airplane Mode when using this to conserve power, as well as prevent interruptions from texts, calls, emails, etc. I'm downgrading this to TWO STARS.

Lastly, I've gone back to using the other style, the kind I broke three times (look for PPA MHL adapter). They all still seem to be crap, but my solution was to plug the micro-USB into the adapter, and then permanently affix the cable to the MHL adapter using Gorilla Tape.

I found both these and the Pelican Micro cases. While Pelican is the gold standard for the larger cases, only the OtterBox cases have the quality I expected in this size. The plastic seems to be more resistant to scratching and cracking, the bottom and top of the case actually 'seal' together, and the top and bottom are both padded to protect the contents from shock, whereas the pelican case only has rubber padding on the bottom half. The hinge opens to slightly over 180 degrees, but it is loose, so where you can open the Pelican lid half way and it will stay, the lid on this case will fall to either full open or full closed. The latches are a little tighter than the pelican case, especially to open, which is a good thing. The protrusions on the top and bottom do not stack.

This review covers the item, boxed, and kitted with TWO SIM adapters in the thin cardboard carton. Identification reads ""Nano-SIM cutter for iPhone5 - including 1 pcs cutter 2 pcs adapters"".  THESE adapters make a big difference in your conversion satisfaction.  Many of the SIM adapter inserts are made of a thin clear or blackened plastic with a very thin translucent poly film covering one side.  The two adapters included in THIS kit (one for Nano-to-Micro and one for Nano-to-Mini sized SIM) both have rectangular holes in the center.  These are critical if you do not cut and ""shave"" your SIM card precisely!  The holes offer a bit of relief so when you insert the card, there is less pressure on the cut SIM;  the extra pressure would cause the SIM to warp slightly, making extraction very difficult or impossible in the future.

Speaking of shaving:  you MUST get yourself a nail file tool like the six-surface ones sold by mall beauty supply shops.  Costs about five bucks.  You need three surfaces: mid-rough, very fine, and polish.  You must shave down the cut Namo-SIM till the info is gone completely, then shave another pass.  Carefully use the fine grit to smooth the SIM and place a gentle chamfer to round out the surface.  THEN you MUST use the rubber polish edge to round out all TEN edges of the card so it feels buttery smooth.  YES, you must smooth down the golden finger edges, too, for best results. THEN, use the fine filing surface to run a few gentle passes over the SIM adapter, particularly the leading edge (on exit).  Polish this smooth also with the rubbery file surface.

After you are done, wipe down your SIM and adapter with a slightly alcohol-moistened microfiber cloth to clean off all your dust and finger oils.

The CUTTING TOOL is a work of art in its practical simplicity.  You slide the big Mini-SIM directly into the slot.  If it's a Micro-SIM, they have included a tiny metal frame for you to place the Micro-SIM;  then you slide it into the same slot in front of the cutter.  I suggest you hold the front of the assembly in towards the cutter body with a soda straw or your finger if you are brave.  Then press down firmly to make the cut.  My cutter arrived slightly out of alignment due to the feeble cushioning (none) in the shipping envelope.  I easily straightened it and added a few tiny globs of Teflon silicone grease on the contact surfaces and main spring.  Smooth as steel butter!

Other than for this problem, the device does appear to work well, providing a much stronger cell signal in my home.

Update: Amazon did email a return label with free shipping. I subsequently found that this is not the same device currently being sold by Verizon. Both being an older model (which doesn't handle 3G) and being a returned item explain why this is less expensive than buying thru Verizon.

If you don't need to improve your 3G signal and you don't have any other houses near you, this would be a good buy.

The opening for the rear camera doesn't obstruct its view nor the flash. Same for the front camera.  The adhesive-backed Bracketron attachment I purchased securely glued itself to the hard plastic back of the Otterbox cover.

Pros:
- all black so people don't try to steal it from you.
- headphones included are alright, included are various sized earpieces
- can hear other party just fine
- easy to use, once you get used to the user interface
- small design
- lightweight
- uses minimal energy, so battery lasts all day long - even when listening to music
- bluetooth has good range, can go through some walls
- connects to my Non-Sony phone without any issues
  - can control MP3 player on my cell phone w/ bluetooth headset
- Seamless integration between listening to music through the computer, then receiving a phone call

Cons:
- during phone conversations = other party might not hear you clearly
  - no noise cancellation
  - background noise can be heard easily by other party
- had trouble connecting headset using a Windows XP computer (no trouble w/ Vista)

Okay, so this is a really good set of wireless headphones and if you don't like the way they fit in your ear, plug in something better into the 3.5 jack.  Sony makes good products and this sony ericsson product is no exception.  It's easy to switch between listening to music from your COMPUTER to FM RADIO to CELL PHONE just by touching a button.  The user interface does take some getting used to and the instructions are just plain confusing.  It's easier just to play around with it.

5.0,True,2010-07-06,A1FMU4CJLIDHR9,B003QOOVIO,,Jaffrey W. Ali,"I have owned the iphone 3GS and now the iphone 4. Between the 2 I have purchased 3 different cases for the iphone 3GS and this is my second case for the iphone 4 (I also have the Apple bumper). The cost of the various cases I have bought have ranged from $20-$50. Here is my basic impression of how the Sonix case stacks up:

1. Build quality: This is a very thin and lightweight case. If you want a case that will protect your phone from drops, the Apple bumper may be a better choice. In fact I did drop the phone with the bumper and there were no scratches. Zero. Haven't had an accident with this one, but it's a nice quality case, with a very nice grip but it's main function is to protect the phone from nicks and bruises in daily use. I have switched to using this as my default case.

2. Design: This is the best 'looking' case I have ever owned! It is very slim and light and compliments the iphone 4 beautifully. Whereas with the Apple bumper you completely lose the metal looks of this band, this one keeps enough highlights of the aluminium band that the phone does not lose any of its attractiveness. With ANY other phone I would not care about cloaking the phone in a case, but the iphone 4 is a thing of beauty! You just need to see it and hold it to know what I mean. This case is unique because it does NOT change either the balance or the looks of the phone. It compliments it very well.

3. Impact on antenna issue: Frankly I have had no dropped calls with my iphone 4. It is better than my iphone 3gs in very way in terms of call quality. In fact I was in the Outer Banks recently and  while my wife Sony Ericsson C902 phone had a hard time keeping a signal for a call, the iphone 4 had no issues. I do have the issue where the bars will drop when you hold the phone a certain way, but it has no impact on my call quality. This case, like the bumper helps in not dropping the bars compared to holding the phone, but it does not help or degrade the call quality. So, if you are looking to get this case to help with call quality I am afraid my experience in both the Washington DC area and the outer banks and places in between says it won't help or hurt...

4. Value: At $19.99 this is a no brainer really. You get the best looking case that is very functional and elegant. I don't really use the screen protector. The screen on the iphone 4 is already pretty glare resistant -  more so than the 3GS, so the screen protector can help with scratches but not for glare. For what it's worth I used my iphone 4 as a GPS for our trip to the outer banks. The screen on the iphone 4 was completely readable even in the brightest and direct sun light. The screen on the iphone 4 is fantastic and covering it up with a protector doesn't seem like a good idea (to me at least).

Overall, I am really happy with this case and would recommend it to anyone.",Simply the best!,1278374400,98.0,,

It was returned 24 hours after getting it due to the overall shortcomings of the WebOS operating system Palm puts on the phone. WebOS treats every function of the phone as an app, meaning that in addition to actual apps (Facebook, camera, maps, etc.) essential functions (phone calls, messaging) are handled in the same manner. The more apps that are open, the slower the phone's performance becomes. Making a simple phone call became somewhat annoying -- you first have to open the calls app, wait for the initial splash screen sequence to complete, then execute your call. When a call is complete, you must quit the telephone app or the dialpad will remain on the screen.

There is a way to safely ""jailbreak"" or change internal WebOS settings; however, the overall performance of the phone (low RAM), lack of available apps and very small, non-adjustable screen text size added to my decision to return the phone.",WebOS is not for everybody,1303776000,3.0,,

To begin with, it doesn't hold the phone tightly unless you bend the corners to fit. To add to the frustration, the cover rubs it's coating against the screen, which isn't that much of a big deal when the screen is on, but when it's off, you have a vertical line going up the right hand side of the screen. The cover does NOT have an indentation to keep the screen from being turned on by the case pressing the home button while closed. Last, and this one's the biggie, I had the phone drop a whole 1.5 feet to the ground. It popped out of the case and bounced on it's edges, then slid face first across the concrete, with the battery cover off and the battery scraped up as well. This case is only good for pockets, and that's only after modifying the case to NOT press on the home button. I would have returned it, but since I cut out a notch where it wouldn't press the home button, that's no longer an option.

I am on the more experienced side of computer and software fiddling, so it wasn't that hard. The hardest part, IMO, was getting the phone into recovery mode, lol. The Palm website doesn't explain it well enough. 1. Plug usb cable to wall charger 2. Take the battery out 3. Hold the volume up button 4. Put battery back in 5. Plug usb cable into phone 6. Continue holding down the volume up button until the usb connectivity logo pops up on-screen.

In conclusion, its the best cheap gsm smartphone on the market AND it comes with a warranty. Its great as an interim phone or back-up phone.",Works great on T-mobile!,1329436800,7.0,,

I didn't think that I would care for the spectrum clip because I had previously used the black and stainless steel version.  I gotta be honest, the spectrum clips are just as awesome and don't bother me one but.

I don't understand why they are cheaper than the others, but once you see the clip in person I'm sure that you will come to appreciate them.

I ordered these clips when they were substantially cheaper here on Amazon, but they have gone up in price and are still a good value.

I stocked up on the clips when they were cheap and now have enough for me and my circle of family and friends.  It is unfortunate that Nite Ize no longer make the clips.  The clips are indestructable within reason and that tape is awesome.  I have never had a problem and I'm on my third device with these clips.

The company that originally holds the patent? I'm just not so sure about using the Carbon Fiber version, but I can't knock it since I haven't tried them.

So with that said - My old battery I was only getting about 4 to 6 hours of batter life, Now I received 2 batteries and one seems to hold a charge more than the other one ( typical I guess somethings are just made better others ) but with Battery (1) I am getting a good 8 hours of normal use, Battery (2) I am getting 17 hours of normal use ( what is normal use you ask ) well I am running Twitter, Facebook widgets as well as PULSE widget on my desktop. I have 4 emails setup ( staggered checking at 30 min 30 min, 1 hour and 2 hours )

It is very lightweight but sturdy, charges in almost any amount of daylight (it even charges by the light of indoor bulbs), and has an adjustable metal stand that you can also hang the lamp by.

I've used the d.light lantern while RVing, backpacking and paddling. I also use it in my own bedroom for night reading, since it uses no electricity and I get a kick out of that. It charges up right away the next morning, so I don't have the worry that I have to conserve my batteries. I can just use this, worry-free. :)

It burns in a nice bright light sufficient for reading and doing detailed tasks. The beam is nicely focused. This is not a diffused area lantern; it's more like the light  from a headlamp. I also own the d.light lantern-style solar light, and that is what I use for lighting a larger area.

The little metal stand adjusts for a range of positions for either collecting photos or emitting them. The directions suggest turning the solar panel to catch the light directly, but since even indirect light charges this device, it's easier to use than the directions suggest.

Although Amazon LLC sells the item, it's over one-third more than other sellers. Before buying, I contacted Amazon customer service and they said I would get a full, no questions asked refund if the phone did not work with my SIM card if I used either Amazon or an Amazon Fulfillment seller. So I went for such a seller, less than Amazon LLC but not the rock-bottom cheapest.

What I received appeared to be in brand new condition: the box was sealed, and so were all the bags inside. The charger has a US plug but can be used overseas. The battery appeared to be new too, and after being charged under three hours held it for over 36 hours.  The phone was unlocked, but T-Mobile branded. It worked with both my T-Mobile SIM and a UK (English) pay-as-you-go SIM.

I wanted a quad band, unlocked GSM cell phone for overseas travel.  This phone fits the bill, and the aesthetics are nice.  Folded, the phone is quite pocketable.  Open, the size is easy enough to manage.  Both the exterior and huge interior screens are color.  The lighted keypad looks like ""Tron"" in its use of a blue florescent design.

The owner's manual is quite skimpy and cheaply printed as other reviewers suggest. But I was able to download the full manual as a PDF from Motorola's web site.  The supplied manual is small enough to keep in a wallet while travelling, though.

I didn't try sending an MMS, but received one or two of SMS advertisements, so text messaging works.  If you want a phone for overseas travel that will work in almost any country with a local SIM card, consider this one.  As long as you buy from Amazon LLC or use a seller with Amazon Fulfillment, you a) probably will not have any problems and b) will at least get a no questions asked refund with the seller paying return shipping if what you receive does not work as described.",No Surprises With Amazon Fulfillment,1322006400,3.0,,

Not so! The back snaps onto the phone and that's nice in itself. It's durable and easy to hold. But if you want to then put it into the belt clip, you must slide the phone into the holder.

I've experienced the Android platform since the Nexus One and I can say that's it gotten so much better.  Some people think that Android is an iPhone/iOS knockoff, and to some respects it that may be true.  However, the similarities stop with the Galaxy Nexus and Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).

The phone is ""the right size"", I think.  It's not to big or small.  After doing a side by side comparison with the iPhone, the difference in screen size makes a difference.  Colors are crisp and video seems to come alive on this screen.  Video doesn't seem like an extravagant slideshow, like on some devices.  The build quality is good.  Some comments on the Internet seem to point out that the phone seems ""cheap"" or ""plasticy"".  I disagree.  The phone feels solid in the hand and is surprisingly light, especially when compared to the iPhone.  I would still do my best to avoid dropping the phone, in which I got a case to protect it against a significant drop.  The buttons and ports are similar to that of the Nexus S, in which the Power is on the right, volume rocker is on the Left, and the USB and headphone jack is on the bottom.  Some people think the headphone jack should be at the top, similar to that of the Nexus One or iPhone, but I can see that Samsung placed the ports on the bottom for the accessories that may come, such as a Car or Desk Dock.  I don't have either, but when I use a generic car holder, it's convenient to have the cords pointing down to stay out of the way.

The real power of the phone is in it's software, Android 4.0 or ""Ice Cream Sandwich"".  The phone feels responsive and smooth to the touch.  I like how they changed the storage memory to become one single partition as opposed to two separate (On-board + USB storage).  It makes for managing applications and memory more efficient, as ""moving to SD card"" was starting to become more trouble than it's worth.  The interface is similar to that of Android 3.0 or Honeycomb, for those who are familiar.

The real question I'm sure your all wondering is the ""build"" of the software.  I can say that my Galaxy Nexus came with ""yakju"".  Yes, I have the Google build of the software.  However, I wasn't satisfied.  With Google selling the Galaxy Nexus on the Google Play Store and having a different Android build ""takju"", I went and did some research.  The good news is that the software is available from Google.  Do a search for ""stock Android ROMs"".  The bad news is that it required a little ""know how"" in computer programming to get the Google sanctioned takju on my Galaxy Nexus, but Voila!.  I have the exact same Google branded phone that Google is selling with all the trimmings (such as Google Wallet), but in White!

Very VERY good phone.  Amazingly fast.  Evermore faster on T-Mobile's HSPA network, getting up to 8MB download speeds on a good day.  I don't know what else to say except that the Galaxy Nexus can quite possibly be the best phone for any phone fanatic out there.  It sets the bar for other Android phones, as well as iPhone.

Pretty solid unit. The plastic case and velcro strap seems very well built. I like it so far! This is way better than the other headrest mounts that are out there because it's easy to insert and remove your iPad without having to unlock or twist anything. Also, most other mounts attach below the headrest so they appear too low for the kids when watching movies. Plus they cost too much because it's built like steel. Come-on guys... it's just a headrest for kids so they can stay quiet and be entertained in the car!

iPADKET was the perfect choice!

-These gloves are black in color with silver weaving speckled between the fabric, giving it a grey-ish look from afar. The silver weaving allows for the capacitive touch response with touch devices. All ten fingers work perfectly. The whole hand, in fact, works well because of the silver weaving throughout the glove. They are thin enough to be worn underneath another pair of gloves, which is probably mandatory for those living in very cold weather conditions (32F and below). An obvious, but unobtrusive ""Aglove"" logo decorates the edge of the glove, but you can easily hide this by positioning it on the inside of your hand instead of the back. Gloves cover all the day down to my wrist (would cover my wristwatch) and keep my hards warm from wind and moderately cold weather. I ordered the S/M and it fits perfectly over my hands, which I generally order M for any other gloves I wear.  Overall, I like them a lot!

Pros:
- Full ten-finger capacitive touch with great responsive feedback
- Length covers down to wrist
- Thin and lightweight
- Keep my hands warm!

Cons:
- Would like more color options
- Would prefer silver weaving only on the fingers, so I can rest my hand on the ipad while writing with a stylus but still use my fingers when required
- Probably too thin for snow or below 32F weather",Very responsive gloves!,1302048000,14.0,,

The problem is that these films are impossible to apply without getting some dust and bubbles. I have gotten about 60% of the screen bubble/dust free but the rest is impossible. Because you peel away the film on the underside as you lay it down, the films create a static that draws dust as you get past about halfway. The instructions to clean the screen in a ""dust free environment"" is laughable. Do they think everyone has access to the clean rooms used in semiconductor fabs or operating rooms? The ""soft card"" intended to scrape away bubbles is also useless, better to just use a credit card with a longer and more usable edge. Perhaps it is worse here in dry Colorado where humidity is low? Another gripe, albeit minor, is that it is difficult to align the film straight over such a large surface. They should really make the front facing camera hole a little larger to avoid alignment issues. Maybe Apple should just start offering matte glass straight from the factory, because this is a waste of time.

After 30 days, the fabric started to fray at the edge from the few times I took my phone out and replaced it each day (about 5 times). Then, the clip broke off of the pouch on April 1, about 60 days after purchase, while it was on my belt. The only thing holding the clip to the phone is a tiny span of plastic.  That broke.  I rarely use the phone, so the pouch gets very light use.  It sits on my belt half the day, snug and undisturbed.  I had another holster as mentioned below for another phone, and that lasted over 5 years - I retired the phone before the holster.

I do not recommend this holster.

Original Review:

The LG800 is a very sleek phone and this carrier is really ONLY for if you have a gel skin cover.  Otherwise, as noted, the carrier is really too big for the phone.

I come from having a small LG clamshell that had a very small belt pouch, now I am still getting use to the LG800 and this pouch.  I love the LG800 as a step up from the clamshell.  I wish I could keep a low profile.

Given the size of the phone itself, the carrier is quite large.  Partly this is the result of the pouch being a tad bit larger than necessary.  Partly it results from the clip extending out a bit rather than being part of the pouch itself.  In a gel case, the phone does fit well in the pouch, while still coming out easily.

The magnetic flap (no button) insures that the phone won't fly out but is not a significant restraint and will not slow your taking the phone out.  Removal of the phone is silent.

The case will rotate (in secure increments) up to 90 degrees - in either a forward or backward direction when hooked to the belt.  SO if you prefer to have the pouch open to the front instead of to the top - yes, it rotates.

The clip has a plastic ""hook"" on the inside clamp and this is what some may have taken issue with.  It makes the phone very secure when hooked to a belt.  I am sure you could file it round if it was truly an issue.

I have no trouble hooking or unhooking the phone if I remember to simply push toward the hook to disengage it from being around the belt.

Other than a bit of shock at the size, I am happy with the pouch.  The is NO hiding this phone on your belt under a jacket or shirt.  As you know th phone alone is sleek and low profile.  But it is slippery and so we get a gel case to protect it from dropping.  Thus...this big pouch.

I would eventually like to find a pouch that fits the phone without a gel case and has as low a profile as the phone.

Hatfield,"I have an [ASIN:B0015G5UVW Peripheral PXAMG Universal iPod Adapter with HD Radio and Auxiliary Audio Capabilities]] in my car that I was using to play my iPhone and iPod through my car stereo and use the steering wheel controls. When the iPhone 5 rumors about the new plug started coming out, I decided it might be a good time to try Android. Now I have a GS3 and needed a way to play through the existing connection, as it provides power as well.

This is what I chose, and it works great.

Now, there are some people who were disappointed that it didn't work for them. Here's how you can tell before you buy: If when you hook your iPhone (or iPod, I believe) up to your connection, if the connection takes over the iPod app and states 'iPod Connected' and doesn't let you work the controls on the phone or iPod, this won't work for you. If your connection can use an AUX mode, where you have full access to the iPod and can change songs or playlists from the device while connected, this WILL work for you.

While the cable is designed to provide audio and power, how well it charges your phone will depend on how much juice your phone requires. This is not a deficit of the dockBoss, there are some Android phones that simply take more juice to charge quickly. If you've got navigation running and your display on torch mode, you could drain your battery even while connected.

I'm really glad this device exists, as it's made the transition that much easier.

The connector cable that comes with the recharger has an ingenious 3 in 1 plug  that enables it to work many different electronic devices. Maybe soon the manufacturer will make a 4 in1 plug for a ""lightening wire"" thus making the acquisition of an extra adaptor (Or carrying the original charging wire) unnecessary.

The TPU material itself is nice and firm, and the case fits very snugly onto the iPhone 5, no slop or flimsy spots at all. The cutouts are also where they should be. The finish is a bit ragged around the corners where you can see slight seams from the manufacturing process, but ultimately you're not buying this for looks, you're buying it for protection, and this case does it perfectly.

The E71 has amazing battery life, my biggest complaint about the iphone.  The sound quality and reception are better on the E71.  The screen is bigger with higher resolution and it's easier to web browse on the iphone.

The E71 wifi is more senstive than the iphone.  I can see and log in to weak hot spots that the iphone can't see. The Nokia Messaging provides html email but the email client is not as good as the iphone.  The iphone does load web pages faster, even on wifi.

I've got apps on my E71 that you can't get on the iphone.  I've got a call recorder and blacklist, which I really like. Also, I've got Jokuspot which turns my E71 into a wifi hotspot.  This app is incredible!

The iphone has threaded messages where the E71 does not.  It's nice to have, but not a big deal to me.

As far as the cameras go, the iphone has a better camera, but lacks a flash.  The E71 flash is the best I've seen on any cell phone I've owned.  It's an auto flash that actually works!  It will adjust the brightness of the flash as needed.  I can take pictures in a dark room and it easily provides enought light to get a good image 10 to 15 feet away.  The E71 camera does cast a purple tint on pictures in low light situations, the main downside of it's camera.

People complain about the small E71 screen, but it goes with the size of the phone.  One thing I really like about the E71 is it's small size.  It's about half the size of a Blackberry Bold.

The E71 is made in Finland, and as others have said, is very well made.  I have no desire to upgrade to the China made E72.

Overall, the E71 is an excellent phone and I highly recommend it.",E71 - A year later,1267228800,6.0,,

Decided I would go cheaper because I wasn't sure how well either would work. I was sick of the misspelled words in texts and anytime I used the iPhone's on-screen keyboard. This model is alright, no more misspelling words etc.. but there are still some basic flaws that I'm sure future models will address. The slide of the keyboard is smooth and satisfying. It adds a lot of weight and size to the phone, maybe even doubling both. The front of the phone sticks out past the casing and is completely exposed, I can easily see my screen breaking the first time I drop this thing. The charging cable does not fit into the keyboards slot, it sticks out and you have to keep pressure on it the whole time it's charging or it will fall out. I wedge mine against the corner of my desk to keep it in. People in reviews have said that the responsiveness of the keys starts to go after awhile, mine is still relatively new and I have not experienced this yet. My 'r' button did stop working, but was fixed after I recharged the keyboard. Even with these flaws the keyboard is a cool accessory, and I've gotten lots of complements on it already.

The Good:
-Large keys
-Easy to text
-Faster (once you adjust to the new key layout)
-Helpful home and search buttons

The Bad:
-Large (weight & size)
-Terrible protection (front is completely exposed)
-Terrible charging cable (needs pressure to stay in)

Here is my feedback:
1. The manual was confusing. It was easier for me than some people would find it, since I have technical experience with computers, networks, etc.
2. I had an easy install since I already had a hole in the ceiling from installing a network cable, so it was easy to thread the cable up to the first floor. If you needed to create a new hole in your ceiling and floor, maybe not so easy.
3. The placement of the antenna on a window up one floor worked great for my location. The recommendations on antenna placement seemed really difficult to comprehend. I got the basic idea and was lucky that it worked well.
4. Works great at my desk, four bars. Near my desk I get three, further away and I get a slight or no effect.

The phone is a Double-Minute phone, so the 400 minutes turned into 800 minutes after I entered the code, at no extra cost.  For 1 year, that is about $7 per month, at an average of 67 minutes of talk time per month.  Of course this is 800 minutes for the whole year.  Depends on how much you talk.

* Tip:  Amazon has been out of stock on the LG flip phone, that was listed around $20.  So we bought it at our local Wal-Mart for only $15, that included the accessories package of travel charger, case, and ear phones.  And the phone is double minutes!

1.0,True,2010-10-05,A3L4D0ZA6539MM,B003SNJ8X6,,JimiHendrix,"It takes forever to get anything done on this phone, if you get some things done at all. That is primarily due to the touch screen being awful. It took 15 minutes to get through the calibration process because the phone simply refused to accept my touch inputs 90% of the time. (At one point, I counted and my touch input was accepted only after 19 attempts.) The touch scrolling through menus is hit or miss at best. Some areas within the phone's menus work well with it, but others do not. And some are like the calibration process--try as you may, the screen either doesn't scroll/move or you open a menu you didn't intend to open. And I don't think that's a freeze issue, but simply a poorly made product.

If you absolutely must have a touch screen phone to appear cool to others, buy it. However, if you want a phone which simply works and allows you to do what you want quickly, don't even think about buying an LG Prime--unless you're primed for frustration. After 6 hours of frustrating usage, this product is being returned. (You can now make that *has* been returned, and within 18 hours of its receipt.)

Addendum: Let me identify other problems I had with this phone. If you miss a call, the locked screen displays a message about the missed call. However, until you unlock the phone, you cannot simply remove that information from the screen. And then given the touch screen doesn't work worth a hoot, I spent 5 minutes getting the touch screen to finally recognize my taps and so I could verify having seen the missed call information. Even worse, as long as the missed call information is displayed on the essentially non-functional touch screen, you cannot unlock the phone with the button on the side. You can't unlock the phone until you unlock the phone's screen, and unlocking the screen is practically impossible. ""Quite a catch, that catch-22.""

As for texting, I finally gave up on getting a single text even written. The touch screen would pick up the wrong alphabet or number at least one-third of the time, if not more. To add to the frustration, I wanted to send the text to someone not in my address book so needed to add the contact. That proved impossible. Although I entered a name (in text only) in the correct field, the phone invariably returned error messages about needing to enter only letters or numerals. Given that, so much for ever at any time entering this person's unique actual name which has a hyphen in it. And editing the already entered text seemed to be one of the last considerations given by the phone's designers, except for...

...being able to do pretty much anything with all contacts by selecting them all at once, excluding deleting them all in one fell swoop. I was returning the phone and needed to remove my personal information, which meant removing the 100+ contacts I'd transferred to it. (Was this purposeful design as not to make deletion of them all an easy error? No way given the menu is significantly buried and a person would have to go far out of their way with several inputs to make such a ""mistake."") As for the master reset, a call to ATT was of no help because the phone was so new that the service person to whom I was speaking could not tell me the master reset code. (True or not? I don't know and now don't care or need to know.) Between those two inconveniences, it took almost an hour to tediously delete each contact individually.

When attempting to input certain information, the phone displays only one of several needed input lines at a time. Additional lines below are covered by the screen's keyboard. Again because of extreme touch screen deficiencies, after entering the first line of information and then needing to navigate to the the second line which was hidden by the virtual keypad, I could not get it to scroll to the additional lines below the one already showing.

In sum, this was the very worst phone I've ever had. Clearly it was given insufficient design considerations--almost to the point of thinking no one at LG attempted to actually use the phone as a customer might before placing it on the market.

(1) For people who plan on using T-Mobile:
(a) At least in my case, this phone works with the grandfathered tzones plan (for those who don't know what it is you get unlimited internet access for $4.99-$5.99 a month).
(b) It works with T-Mobile's strange 3.5G bands, which is used only by T-Mobile and, I believe, a few Canadian carriers. While I was visiting the Atlanta area I was getting download speeds of over 12.

(2) For people who have not purchased an unlocked phone before:
(a) This phone is not sold in the US so it will be a phone intended for another country (in my case, Colombia). This means that you do not get a warranty in the US so it is essential that you try it out when you get it to make sure that it is working well. I purchased mine from HassleFreeCells and based on some conversations with the seller I have no doubt that if there is a problem when you get it they'll take care of you - even if they charge a few extra bucks it's worth the peace of mind.
(b) The fact that it is a foreign phone doesn't make too much of a difference EXCEPT for the fact that Nokia sets up updates based on your phones country code. For example, Microsoft is making some of their programs available on Belle.  It is already available for the UK and some other countries, but not Latin America so I can't get those programs yet.
(c) Even though this is a phone intended for Colombia you can select multiple European languages including US English, so that isn't an issue.

(3) For people who own other Nokia phones:
(a) Besides this phone I also have a C6-01 which has a clear black screen whereas this phone uses an ips screen. The screen on the C6-01 is brighter and has better colors, contrast and blacks, but the screen on the 701 is much more viewable outside.
(b) This phone comes with Belle from the start (although as soon as you start it it requires an update). Compared to running Belle on the C6-01 (which was updated to Anna from Symbian3 and finally to Belle) this phone is faster and more ""fluid"". I'm assuming that is because this phone has a faster processor and double the ram, so if that's the case the same should be true for other older pre Belle Nokia phones such as the E7 and N8. Belle is a mixed bag. It has more eye-candy and is more up to date in the sense that it resembles Android and iOS5, but it gives up tons of features such as folders, etc. that made Symbian seem much more like a real operating system. Also be aware that as always in Nokia land the switch to Belle has created tons of problems. Lots of older apps such as QuickOffice (one of the few Office compatible programs) no longer work with Belle and some newer apps such as Moodagent are having issues.  Since Symbian is a dead operating system walking the incentive for programmers to update their programs to solve this issue is lessened.

In sum, I gave this phone a five because the price is great, I will be able to use it in 98% of the world with local sim cards and have local maps and 3g coverage, it is easy to use and has all the functionality I need.  If those are your needs this is a near perfect phone.  However, if you have never used an unlocked phone or a Nokia think carefully before buying it.  In terms of support you are basically on your own, you have no factory warranty, and the app selection for common apps on other smart phones such as Netflix, Pandora, etc. is non-existant. Although Nokia has stated that they will support Symbian until at least 2016 you can't expect much interest in an operating system that has been thrown to the curb - and given that Nokia's market share is in free-fall at the moment there is even a real possibility that they won't be in any position to offer even limited support in the near future.

Here's an update on my 701.  My daughter needed to borrow the phone so as recommended in the manual I attempted to do a factory restore from the menu setting - huge mistake. The phone got stuck in a loop and 2.5 hours later it was still in a loop, even after removing the battery and reinstalling, trying to connect to the pc, etc. My only option was to do a hard reset which besides loosing a bunch of the factory installed software (no big deal) did not allow active exchange or the Nokia store to work anymore. I tried reinstalling my backup (as suggested by Nokia support) - did not work. A quick look at the internet forums showed that the 701 needs to be reflashed if you do a hard reset and since this is not a US phone you're basically on your own.  Nokia did offer to ""downgrade"" it to a 700 or C6-01 which is actually quite nice since this is a non-US phone, but I sent it to a third party Palco Cell Phone Repair where they say they can reflash it for $42 (we'll see). What it all boils down to is that I went ahead and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Nexus for just a bit more which is unlocked, pentaband GSM, 4.65"" screen and so forth for just a few bucks more with a US warranty.  It really is absurd to sell a phone that can not be restored to factory in an age when tons of your private info (including cc numbers, etc.) is stored on the phone. Although I still like the phone, and will keep it as a backup if it gets fixed, it's time to leave Nokia behind. Unless you're willing to settle for a WIndows phone Nokia has nothing left worth buying in the US anymore.",A few specifics -update,1329523200,18.0,,

Let me begin by saying that of all the product reviews I've submitted to Amazon not very many receive 5 stars.

I could have been throwing my money away on another relatively expensive ""gimmicky"" gadget.  Fortunately I took a chance and ordered this from Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  This product is perfect for my 5"" Garmin GPS.

On the day I received it, I put my GPS unit into the bracket and installed the CD slot mount in my 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe.  I then drove over some roads that were more pot hole than road with absolutely no problem.  It held my GPS securely with nary a movement.  In my vehicle, the device does obscure the clock, and some radio controls.  However this is not a problem, as these controls are duplicated on the steering wheel.  Although this product comes with absolutely no written instructions, the installation into the CD slot, as well as other adjustments I've described below, should be fairly self explanatory once you see it.

A couple of words of advice.  If this is being used for a GPS, you will likely need to remove the little plastic ""foot"" which is at the bottom of the bracket as shown in the picture, (it comes off quite easily if you're careful), and then rotate the arms so they are positioned at the top and bottom.  Then just squeeze the arms together until your GPS is held securely in place.

They use a ""wet"" method to install. U have to make sure there is NO lint around. Comes with a sprayer and sqeege. Takes about 10 minutes to install. Make sure you turn your phone off and remove the battery first. Get BOTH sides of the film very wet and put it in the exact position you want, then squeegee the air out working from the center out. There will be small micro-bubbles for a day or two until it fully dries. Once it does it'll be flawless.

The Lowepro phone case easily fits and Iphone as well as additional memory cards.  Unlike the Black Rapid line, the Lowepro will fit an Iphone with an Otterbox. The build quality, as usual, screams of excellence with serious quality control. The design is not bulky and the case can be attached to nearly any Lowepro product using the slip-lock system. A key aspect of the design is the thoughtful outer construction that prevents this case from snagging on other items.  The brushed lining protects the phone screen from scratches.  The dual zipper system, with over-sized pulls, makes access (both opening and closing) a pleasure, allowing one-handed use, unlike most other products. A great feature I use frequently is the interior pocket to store earbuds.  The outer material is not intended to be waterproof.  However, I was out in pouring Tennessee rain with the case exposed and when I got back inside, no moisture at all made its way into the case.

The case is very well designed in the context of protecting your phone (or whatever electronic device you choose to store in it). However, I see no possible way the slip-lock system would fail anyway.

Jones,"A difficult choice for those looking for a cellular booster for their home is whether to purchase the zBoost YX545 Wireless Extenders or the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster. The zBoost is #1 on Amazon in the celluar signal booster category while the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster is #2.

We could not decide which one to purchase for our mountain cabin so we ended up ordering both units and put them to the test. For our mountain cabin, we get 2-3 bars outside and can make calls and get data connections. Because the cabin has a metal roof, 6"" walls and heavy insulation, we could not get any signal inside the cabin, so calls and data connections were impossible.

We installed the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster first. The yagi directional antenna was installed at the roof peak and the booster with inside antenna installed next to the TV in the living room. After powering up the unit, this is the coverage we achieved inside the cabin using an iPhone in test mode:

iPhone next to inside antenna:
  4-5 bars (-70dBm)
  Speedtest: 190ms ping, .8 - 1.5 Mbps data transfer

iPhone 8 feet away from inside antenna in same room:
  3 bars (-89dBm)
  Speedtest: 227ms ping, .8 - 1.4 Mbps data transfer

iPhone in bedroom 30 feet away:
  1 bar (-106dBm)
  Speedtest: No ping, no data transfer

We then tested the zBoost YX545 cellular booster. Like others who have reviewed this unit. The coax cable which comes with it is a joke, way too thin. So to make a fair test, we used the same coax cable which we used with the Wilson Electronics cellular booster. We installed the zBoost antenna to the existing coax in the same location at the peak of the roof, and the zBoost booster in the living room at the other end. After powering up the unit, this is the coverage we achieved inside the cabin using an iPhone in test mode:

iPhone next to inside antenna:
  4-5 bars (-66dBm)
  Speedtest: 205ms ping, .8 - 1.13 Mbps data transfer

iPhone 8 feet away from inside antenna in same room:
  4 bars (-73dBm)
  Speedtest: 230ms ping, .4 - .55 Mbps data transfer

iPhone in bedroom 30 feet away:
  1 bar (-106dBm)
  Speedtest: No ping, no data transfer

What we found is the coverage for both units is the same, one room. The number of coverage bars and dBm's were also the same, but for some reason the Wilson Electronics unit achieved higher data rates using Speedtest.

We ended up keeping the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster due to the higher data rate and better name brand but the zBoost YX545 would have been acceptable for our use as well. Neither unit provided whole house coverage which would have required spending a lot more money to achieve.",Good for Single Room Coverage,1350172800,97.0,,

I think they just wanted people to pay their $99 for their more expensive GMOS-04 unit, saying that unit would work in the Trailblazer. Anyway.....
At first I didn't think it would work because I could get two different units to power up and all functions seemed to work but I had a problem getting sound out of any speakers. At first I thought maybe I had blown the internal amp of the new stereo but when the older one worked exactly the same (no sound), I thought that I couldn't possibly have blown the internal amps of both units, could I? so after re-reading the wiring instructions and making sure everything was connected proberly, I began paying attention the blue/white wire that I kept reading that was supposed to be an ""amp turn on"" wire. I had no clue what that was supposed to be until I read the blue caution tag that was on the blue wire of my older stereo that not only mentioned it could be connected for an auto antenna signal but for and amp signal...etc. Hmmm... So, I connected that blue wire to the blue/white wires of the harness and tried connecting everything in the car. Wallah! I now have sound!! Who would've thought. So, I took the brand new stereo and connected it's blue wire the same as I did the old one....again, Wallah! Sound!
I have to admit that I gave this unit 4 starts because in the instructions it mentions these blue/white wires to be amp turn on wires and not auto antenna wires. I think they need to update the instructions and do a bit more research on how different stereo manufacturers use their terms to explain the unit's functions and wires. Also, I am not pleased, as others have mentioned, about the creation of the tones used for the ""GM tones"". They ARE very loud and short. The original tone was more laid back and sounded as if it were such as a tubular bell being struck and not so peircing to the ear. These sounds out of this unit are just three very loud and fast bursts of tone which will take some getting used to. I know a person can adjust for the loudness but it doesn't make them any more pleasing.
The next and final reason for the 4 star rating is because I think it's an awkward idea to just have a person tap the brown wire to ground in order to get the Onstar level louder or softer. Why didn't the makers of this unit simply put a push button on the unit and label it the Onstar volume button so one could just simply push it momentarily to adjust the volume? Currently I am not signed on for the Onstar service anyway so I guess if I get in a crash I'm out of luck by them.
I have yet to fully install the new stereo in my dash because I have spent all this time and money making sure it was going to work first before I either install it or put the original stereo back in and forget a new one in this vehicle for now. I hope I can get everything to fit in such a cramped space with stereo, wires, and new oversized box. It is much larger than I expected.
All in all I think this company is on the right track and I hope the newer units are better and they have fixed some of these issues that I have read other reviewers have also complained about. I just can't afford to pay the prices for these units at this time.
One final question, does anyone know if these units have issues with being battery drainers? Seems I read that by a reviewer some where. Any comments would be great.",It worked in my Chevy 05 Trailblazer!,1289433600,9.0,,

The only real drawback is that the power button is at a weird angle and this case doesn't make it any easier to push down.  There's almost no space between the earpiece speaker grille and the power button so the button sits right against the plastic, and while this isn't really Seido's fault I do think it could have been engineered better.  It's only a minor gripe though, since I've already gotten used to it and it's not a big deal.

The pros far outweigh the cons on this case.  It's sleek, feels great in the hand, and will keep your phone from getting scuffed up if you happen to drop it.  It also lets you set it on a desk without it resting on the camera protrusion, and on its face without the glass touching anything.  It does add some bulk, but nothing you can't get used to quickly.

The clip on the case is only for horizontal us - that's great for me because I wouldn't want to use it in any other position.  The clip is fixed and does not rotate, so horizontal is the only position you can use this case in.  The clip is very sturdy and is working very well for me in this position,

UNBOXING: My phone came with Nokia's Car Kit which was a nice surprise. The phone bracket can be placed on the dash for using the GPS when flying down the highway. A car charger AND home charger are included along with some fancy headphones. The only accessory I needed to add was a case. Otter Box makes a great case for the X6.

SET-UP: Wonderfully easy to set-up. I inserted my SIM card and plugged in the charger then off to the races. Initial set-up is quick, easy, and intuitive. Within minutes my contacts, email, 3G, and internet were running fluidly.

TOUCH SCREEN: It takes a bit to get used to the screen, especially coming from a tactile keyboard on my old E71. Some actions require a double-tap while others are single taps. There is a slight color change on the buttons letting you know that a second tap is needed. If your impatient and keep hitting the buttons the X6 will lock-up. Patience, young grasshopper, patience.

CALLS: No dropped calls so far with good sound clarity. The screen automatically disables itself so your cheek won't activate anything. Voice dialing is a breeze to set-up.

INTERNET: Initally the X6 was somewhat slow using the built in web browser, but then I downloaded the Opera browser. Whoa Nelly! The Opera browser flies along with proper 3G speeds. Web pages can be zoomed in/out if that site is not mobile ready.

MUSIC/VIDEO: The X6 has 16gb memory on board. More than enough for my music and videos. The sound is somewhat ""tinny"" when played through the speakers but the included headset makes up for it. Videos play without any chop and the screen resolution is wonderful.

A-GPS: You will need a data plan to use the GPS. The GPS only took one minute for initial set-up and locking. The OVI Maps are okay, but installing Google Maps allows you to sync with Google and keep all your starred favorites. The Ovi Maps didn't show my street, but Google did.

BLUETOOTH: My Plantronics Voyager Pro paired to the X6 within seconds. No connection issues.

WIFI: Again, the Wifi worked immediately. I tested the Wifi at Borders, Starbucks, McDonalds, and the local park. No issues with scanning.

CAMERA: 5mp is decent for a cellphone and the X6 doesn't slouch one bit. The Carl Zeiss lens helps, but you'll still need decent lighting. The video is adequate but nowhere near HD quality.

IMPRESSION: Excellent value for the money, especially since the X6 is unlocked. No issues surfing the web, listening to music, taking pictures or watching videos. The X6 does everything it's supposed to plus more.",Excellent phone for the money,1296518400,7.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NeDqkuk0L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yVlNN0TeL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ryrj1xVNL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ByzFVGFqL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51+o+CXsmwL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ay8LN3e+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41uYN5WbVGL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4qH30-oL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nh+WnhAOL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516ZhYH98oL._SY88.jpg']",

The larger battery gives the phone a lot more heft.  With its new cover on, the phone has the feel of an iPhone 4 in weight and depth. QCell did a great job on the rear ports on the battery cover.  The Flash, Camera, and Speaker are all almost perfectly centered in their cavities. Photos don't seem to be affected by the deeper case around the camera.

I'm not happy that the cover does not fit snugly to the body of the phone.  I have an AT&T S3.  In the middle of each side of the phone, there is a gap between the cover and the phone.  I can easily slide a card in the gap.  What that means, is that it will be easier for dust to enter the phone.  Not good as dust can damage the phone's internals. I'm hoping that over the next few days the cover settles in and starts fitting more snugly.

My Galaxy S3 is Pebble Blue.  The cover that comes with this package is close, but noticeably not a match for the cover that came with the phone.  The Samsung cover is painted to make it appear as if the plastic were brushed metal.  Samsung did a very credible job making their plastic cover look like aluminum.  The QCell cover looks like plastic.  It has that grainy look that colored plastic has.  Not a deal-breaker though.  The gaps on the sides are the real problem.

For the price I paid, its not worth returning.  Especially since the battery appears to be working as advertised.  I'll give it a try for a couple of days and see how much dust accumulates in the phone. At the worst, I'll use the QCell battery and its cover when I'm travelling, and their Samsung counterparts otherwise.

They missed spots with the red spray paint and it didn't snap together properly, leaving gaps. I decided to get this gray one to see if the quality was any better. I was very happy to find that it is. You can tell it's made by a different manufacturer. On the back half, the black rubbery coating goes all the way around to the inside where the phone sits, whereas on the other one it was just gross bare white plastic that they didn't care to spray paint. The case fits together well enough, there aren't gaps but there's a slight slight rough edge where they meet. Not a huge deal. The color is not as dark as what is pictured, it's more of a light gray, almost silvery, rather than medium gray, and it's not really a deal breaker, but it's the one thing I'm most disappointed about.

UPDATE: I've used it commuting to/from work for 2 weeks now and love it even more.  Bonus discovery -> iphone4 speakerphone works great from it's position right in front of me.  I can hear great, and people can hear me well.  Bye, bye headset!

Positioning is perfect:
- it will save your nerves and prevent accidents
- a quick flick of your eyes and you can see your GPS directions or the song your playing (see my pics of this in my Nissan Xterra)
- a quick tap of your finger, without moving eyes from the road and you skip songs

Adjustment is perfect:
a) there are little buttons at the base of the big spongy side lobes that you press to adust to the width of your device. set these once, and forget.
b) at the bottom of the device, there are little feet (they arrive folded in - don't forget to fold out) that you can adjust to support the bottom of you iPhone/iPod so it supports it without blocking the charging plug
c) the backside of the device has ball in a socket with a tensioning knob allowing you to set the up/down left/right angle to whatever is good for you then tighten the knob so it stays that way

Holds my iPhone 4 great:
- absolutely no worries of it falling out
- it's firmly held by the adjustable spongy side-lobes, the adjustable cradle bottom feet, and the angle of the mount
- it can charge easily

Looks good (with my black interior)

Only downside for me (but this wasn't a big deal for me) the included extra charging cable did not work for me since its iPhone interface metal tab depth wasn't deep enough to make contact with my iPhone charging port with my case on, so I just kept using the standard issue white one that came with one of my i-devices.

Where I work I don't always have a signal, so for this battery to last as long as it did, that is pretty good for me.

Similarly it will work with the old style connector on old style devices - assuming you have both (device and connector). Likewise it will work with other devices, even non-Apple products, if they power off a USB port and you have the connecting cable for that 3rd party device.

There's no need to buy the older 10 watt model of this Apple iPad charger. This is the one that was introduced with the iPad 4 to allow faster charging (20% faster in theory) and it is backwards compatible with all iOS devices from the original iPhone through the Touches and up to the tablets. It may (or may not) charge SOME of the Apple devices faster than the original chargers that came with them (hopefully, for example, the iPad 3) - Apple has a way of reading the power capacity of its devices and providing more power if it is safe. If it is NOT safe to deliver more power on an Apple device, the charger will revert to a lower power mode for safe charging.

With non-Apple products, the odds are this charger will revert to 5 watt or even lower USB power standards to protect third part devices. Even if the third party device is a tablet that would be happy with more power and can in fact draw more power from its own stock charger.

What this means in terms of actual use is this:

1. You can replace all the tiny cube and former larger rectangular Apple chargers with this when you travel, and each Apple device you attach will draw the right amount of power.

2. You can safely use this on non-Apple products, but is they want a lot of power the Apple probably won't deliver it since the Apple charger won't know that's ""safe.""

So the Apple charger is close to, but not quite, a ""one stop"" replacement for all the other USB port chargers you have. It WILL work with 3rd party devices, but maybe charge some of them more slowly than their own native charger will.

Blame the USB standards group for not adopting a universal protocol for communicating ""safe power"" levels through the USB ports, not Apple. At least  we don't have to carry both classic Apple cube, and the larger iPad chargers, around all the time (unless you have to charge them both at the same time, in which case don't throw out or give away or old Apple cube charger).

FWIW we have used the new charger on a Google Nexus 7 tablet (charges as fast as the stock charger), on iPhone 3gs and iPhone 4, on iPad mini, 3 and 4 and haven't had a hiccup. Even on an old dumb phone with a micro USB port.

-------------------------------------------------------

You can love or hate Windows Phone OS, but you have to admit, Nokia sure stepped up their game in designing this beauty.

HARDWARE:

""Borrowed"" heavily from its N9 sibling, this is one stunning phone to look at. Poly-carbonate body means very scratch resistant and none of that slippery glass surface, unlike a certain smartphone. The curves also make it very comfortable to hold, especially over a long period of time, also unlike a certain square-ish phone. Speaker and microphone neatly at the bottom while micro USB port and sim slot are at the top.

The screen is amazing. The 3.7"" Clearblack LCD (aka Super AMOLED or whatever you want to call it) gives you such vibrant colors that my retina-display iPhone 4 looks like a last-gen screen next to it, at least in terms of colors and contrasts. The touchscreen is very sensitive, though I've noticed it can be a bit jumpy at times. No idea if it's a software or hardware problem, or just my screen protector.

The only problems I have with the designs are: a) the dedicated camera button. It's a two-stage shutter (slightly press to focus and fully to shoot) is a bit flimsy. b) the micro-USB port cover flips up and can easily be broken. And it stays this way while connected. (This has been remedied with the upcoming Lumia 900 btw.)

Overall, this is the best looking phone I've seen in years. Kudos to Nokia for trying something new. And dare I say, they succeeded brilliantly.

SOFTWARE:

It's Windows Phone 7.5 Mango. You either love it, or hate it.

Let me say that coming from Android/iOS, the first main differences I saw were the big and bold tiles, and the minimal homescreen. No gazillions of icons and folders cluttering up the screen. Everything is right there, in your face. Phone, SMS, Mail, Browser are all there and easily accessible the moment you turn on the screen. Very cool, I thought. But then, as an avid app user, I loaded up the Windows Marketplace. And boy, was I in for a huge disappointment. I'd known that this was a new ecosystem and there wouldn't be that many apps yet. But I didn't think that many of the iOS/Android apps (not games, don't care about those) that I often used wouldn't have an alternative for WP (more on this later).

I was ready to return the phone. But then (yes, another turning point), I started using it. And I fell in love. The way Live Tiles work, instant updated info without loading the apps. The way ""People"" combines all/most of your social networks into one place. The way I stopped using my phone to do useless things and actually get stuff done. And of course, the way the Lumia 800 felt in my hands.  Also, slowly, I started discovering new ways to find the apps that I want/need. Sure, I had to compromise and discarded certain apps that I don't really need, but I did manage to gather a good number of apps in the end.

Windows Phone 7.5 isn't perfect. I still hate the way copy/paste is implemented. I still think the keyboard is awkward at times and too sensitive at others. I hate that there's no jailbreak/root, or as WP users call it ""Interop unlock"". Or how background tasking has a 9-processes limit. Or how there's no way to change text size in SMS. Or that the default Marketplace is rather unwelcoming and harder to navigate. And many more. But these minor bugs and inconveniences all become irrelevant when you look at the big picture. Windows Phone 7.5 is a brilliant mobile OS. You might call it the smartphone OS for newbies. I'm guessing the reason why it hasn't attracted that many people yet is the lack of quality phones. We haven't seen anything that is so stylish, so cool that can actually compete with the annual iPhone and monthly Androids. Until now.

I'm definitely getting a Lumia 900 when it comes out in a few months (though I'll miss the curved glass). Good job Nokia and Microsoft. You've won me over.

Update: I forgot to mention that the 800 has battery issues (doesn't last very long). I hear that there's a new update out that has fixed this problem, but I'm still waiting for them to push it out to my phone. Will confirm when I get it.",Stunning product.

-They don't cover the buttons on the bottom and were not cut to fit perfectly on top around the speaker (instead it is just a huge cut out as depicted in the photo.

Being that my personal phone is an Android-based phone that I prefer over the iPhone anyway, I decided to the LG Shine for a sim-card swap rather than get the iPhone repaired.

The LG Shine works very well. The call quality is just as good as any smartphone I've used. Its interface is fast and easy to use. Its network performance is terrific, and I'm getting coverage in areas that I can't manage to get signal on my smartphone.

Just so it's clear: this phone does not have any email functionality, except for Yahoo Mail, AOL, AIM, Windows Live, AT&T Yahoo, BellSouth, Comcast, Earthlink, Juno, MindSpring, and NetZero. These appear to be hard-coded into the Java Applet it uses for email, so don't plan on any mail functionality on the phone unless you have one of the above services (also note, that due to the phone's age, this functionality may no longer be supported by your email provider, either).

Its reflective surface makes it very fingerprint-prone, and the number keys don't have a consistent level of lighting, but neither of these make it unusable. I found that the movement ""stick"" for moving around the interface takes a little bit of time to get used to. The ring volume is modest, but perfectly adequate for when I'm carrying the phone in my pants pocket. Despite this, the speakerphone is more than loud enough.

The battery life is terrific. It can last over 48 hours under heavy use. I haven't had an opportunity to test its Bluetooth functionality, unfortunately.

The phone I received has AT&T branding, but it just so happened that my SIM card is for AT&T, so all of the AT&T-specific services work correctly.

The phone is very similar in design and network compatibility as a phone I used when living in South Korea, and I have no doubt that I will be able to bring this phone with me and swap the SIM if I choose to return to South Korea. This comes as no surprise, being that LG is a Korean company.

It is therefore essential to buy from the right source. In the case of this product, that source is Simple Cell, Inc., and the excellent charger/data cord I received from them is the subject of this review. First off, the product is indeed authentic Samsung of the model and rating stated. The standard USB transformer operated over a 120-240 VAC range, 50 and 60Hz. Its output is standard USB 5VDC at a maximum of .75A (or 750 mA). While some other transformers may offer ratings as high as 1.0 ADC, smart phones will not draw that much current, even when charging from a dead flat condition, so the small difference in output current is unimportant. I suspect the charging issues others have reported may be due to having received either very different (but similar looking) product, or non authentic merchandise from some seller OTHER than Simple Cell, Inc.

The zBoost is #1 on Amazon in the celluar signal booster category while the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster is #2.

We could not decide which one to purchase for our mountain cabin so we ended up ordering both units and put them to the test. For our mountain cabin, we get 2-3 bars outside and can make calls and get data connections. Because the cabin has a metal roof, 6"" walls and heavy insulation, we could not get any signal inside the cabin, so calls and data connections were impossible.

We installed the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster first. The yagi directional antenna was installed at the roof peak and the booster with inside antenna installed next to the TV in the living room. After powering up the unit, this is the coverage we achieved inside the cabin using an iPhone in test mode:

iPhone next to inside antenna:
  4-5 bars (-70dBm)

  Speedtest: No ping, no data transfer

We then tested the zBoost YX545 cellular booster. Like others who have reviewed this unit. The coax cable which comes with it is a joke, way too thin. So to make a fair test, we used the same coax cable which we used with the Wilson Electronics cellular booster. We installed the zBoost antenna to the existing coax in the same location at the peak of the roof, and the zBoost booster in the living room at the other end. After powering up the unit, this is the coverage we achieved inside the cabin using an iPhone in test mode:

iPhone next to inside antenna:
  4-5 bars (-66dBm)
  Speedtest: 205ms ping, .8 - 1.13 Mbps data transfer

iPhone 8 feet away from inside antenna in same room:
  4 bars (-73dBm)
  Speedtest: 230ms ping, .4 - .55 Mbps data transfer

iPhone in bedroom 30 feet away:
  1 bar (-106dBm)
  Speedtest: No ping, no data transfer

What we found is the coverage for both units is the same, one room. The number of coverage bars and dBm's were also the same, but for some reason the Wilson Electronics unit achieved higher data rates using Speedtest.

We ended up keeping the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster due to the higher data rate and better name brand but the zBoost YX545 would have been acceptable for our use as well. Neither unit provided whole house coverage which would have required spending a lot more money to achieve.",Good for Single Room Coverage,1350172800,97.0,,

You should read the description and realize that this case also comes with a screen protector. Me, who didn't fully read the description, ordered a screen protector separately and now I have two...  The screen protector, by the way, is high quality, sturdy and went on pretty painlessly in about 10 seconds. I have a piece of lint under there that's going to eventually drive me nuts, but I don't dare lift the screen protector to dig it out because that usually just makes things worse.

2. Somebody said this case is overpriced for what you get. Considering my above statement that it comes with a screen protector, which sells separately for $11, you're basically getting this case for $15 (once you add on S/H). I think it's worth closer to 10, but I'm a cheapskate. You decide.

3. This shouldn't be called a case. It's a protective cover for the back of your Galaxy. ""Case"" implies that it covers the entire thing. I knew it wouldn't because the pictures make that clear.  That's just me being picky about semantics, but still.  From reading reviews, apparently the name confused some people.

4. I feel better with this thing on my new Galaxy than if it didn't have it. With the screen protector on the front and this case on the back, I can throw my Galaxy in my purse and not worry about any harm coming to my shiny new toy.  That's the case's job and it does it. Snaps on and off easily, no struggling or cursing. The slight rubbery feel of it is pleasant. Overall, this case seems high quality.  It integrates smoothly with the Galaxy's shape and is almost completely unnoticeable once on.

I tried a Jawbone 2 when it first came out and found it impossible to get it to fit properly.  So I returned it.  After the raves for the Icon, along with indications that it has improved fit over previous designs, I decided to take another chance when I needed to get a second headset to carry in my car.  My reason for trying it was that with all of the claims about the sound quality, I was hoping it would offer an improved experience with conference calls at work when working from home.  The Plantronics 975 that I've been using does a good job, but I decided to see if I could get an even better one.  My plan was to replace the Plantronics that I use at home with the Icon and carry the Plantronics in the car.

When I received the Icon, I was very pleased to see that the fit problems were a thing of the past... fit went from impossible with the Jawbone 2 to excellent with the Icon.  Then I went on to actual usage.  I tried it on 2 different conference calls the day I received it.  To say that I was disappointed is an understatement.  With the first call, I immediately noticed that I was having problems hearing anyone who wasn't very near to the phone on the other end.  The voices of those people would fade in and out constantly.  I tried playing around with the phone's volume with no improvement.  I was able to switch from the Icon to the Plantronics part way through the call, and the sound quality on my end with the Plantronics was dramatically better... fading wasn't a problem at all and I could hear everyone in the room.  The phone on the conference call end was a full duplex phone, designed specifically for good conference call performance.

Since I didn't want to base a conclusion on one test, I tried the Icon on a second call that was in a different room at work, thus a different phone.  I started with the Icon and had the same problem with voices fading in and out.  A switch mid-call to the Plantronics resolved that issue and allowed me to participate effectively in the meeting.

Now, I do realize that the Jawbone's claim to sound quality fame mostly deals with the sound quality of speech that the folks on the other end of the line experience.  But I certainly expected that they'd put in the effort to make a high quality listening experience as well.  That the Icon fell so short in that respect as compared to the Plantronics took me completely by surprise.

I submitted the return for the Icon at the end of that work day.  I'm going to order another Plantronics 975 as my ""car unit"".  I had high hopes for the Icon, but it definitely didn't live up to them.",Sound quality much poorer than expected.,1282176000,4.0,,

1) It smells awful when new. Really awful. My whole apartment smelled like nasty chemicals within minutes of opening the package. However, a few hours of airing and it's fine. So, if you get this, i guess try to open it outside and leave it somewhere to breathe for a while before you bring it indoors.
2) It fits my tiny little arms, but if you're on the large side, it might not fit you. The maximum size is a modest ~13 inches.
3) My iPhone 3GS fits well, but not tightly enough that i'd trust it for any exercise with much vertical movement. You can remedy this by just slipping a rubber band over the armband once the phone's inside.

It feels safe if it were to fall and adds a grip that is very welcomed, especially with a smartphone where I feel as if it will slip out of my hand. When you put the case on you will need to get use to not touching the rubber on the sides or the screen while your swiping the screen. But you get accustomed to it quickly.

My only issue is that when i try to type the word ""p"" about 1/3 of my thumbs lays on the rubber casing which became annoying. But I have become accustomed to this.

This case is perfect and leaves peace in mind knowing it won't slip out of your pocket. The rubberized case simply sticks inside your pocket and stays put. Sometimes it becomes a hassle with gym shorts where it takes your whole pocket out.

The volume control, power button and camera button are covered by the case, while the charging, microsd slot and speaker are cut out. Overall im impressed and would recommend this to anyone who owns a Samsung Prevail. It just feels great knowing your protecting your 180$ piece of entertainment.

P.S. don't buy this case for the headphone bag or the usb cable because your phones charger also doubles up as a usb cable so this case's usb cable is not needed. The headphone case is a large and I would like something smaller for my headphones.

** Update August 28th 2011 **
So I had this case for a while now and I dropped my phone a total of 8 times. Mostly because im clumsy. Guess what ? Phone is completely protected, no scratches, absolutely nothing ! Nothing to the screen. The case itself is hardly scratched up. Its definitely a life saver for a phone that I do want damaged.

Also the usb cable is worthless and I ended up losing the headphone case but its fine, I didn't really need to use them.

** Update April 4th 2012**
Well well well, I'm glad that my phone is still alive after all these months. The case is still in great condition as well as my phone which has fallen about 20 times every since I purchased this case. I feel very safe now whenever my phone drops because I know It will still work once I pick it up. I even threw the phone to the ground a couple of times and it still just as functional as day 1.

I guess I can finally wrap up this review as their is no need to keep updating.

My final thoughts:
Its a great case, it will protect your prevail and you will never have to worry. The screen will not get scratched from falls. The vibration from the fall will not kill the phone. My only issue with the case is that its sometimes hard to pull out with certain pants/shorts. But then again that's a positive because the phone will not slip out of your pocket.

Build-The Sony Ericson Xperia Mini pro is a very solid built phone.  I have the white one and I'd say it looks very good.  Definitely an attractive design. The keyboard slides out and it doesn't seem flimsy.  The Buttons on the keyboard are good sized (I have no problems using it and I have bigger than average hands.  They also have a very satisfying click when depressed.  Other reviews say the battery cover is hard to get off and I'll confirm that. (it was a hassle because I didn't want to break the phone the day I got it.  Other reviews say the charger door cover is hard to remove that is not true (at least in my case.)

Screen- excellent quality, it is bright has a good viewing angle.  It's about 3in which is on the smaller side but I have no problem with it. (it gets the job done) The Sony Bravia mobile engine does a great job of rendering photos and videos.

UI- this is where the phone really shines.  I love Sony's interface.  It makes use of the space that it is provided and it does this well.  It has four corners on the main screen that you can put up to four apps in each for a total of 16.  Definitely handy especially for those more commonly used apps.  Overall a very playful interface.

Sound Quality-  During calls (my end) sounds good no static or random noises.  other end  people tell me that they can hear me great so I'll take their word.

Speakerphone- another great feature of the Xperia Mini.  Very loud, no distortion.  Great quality with Xplod on.

I use this phone through AT&T and all I had to do was put the sim card in and it worked. 3g is fast.

Overall this phone is excellent 9.5/10. The only con is it's on the thick side.  Hard to fit into pockets. (easy for women [purses] for men it defiantly has presence in your pocket.)
Great interface, great sound quality, amazing build quality, very fast 1ghz processor. (I haven't experienced slow down yet.  If your looking for a compact smartphone loaded with features THIS IS IT.  I would recommend this item with confidence.",Great Compact phone!!!!,1318291200,3.0,,

--Easy to install onto Verizon Galaxy Nexus (SCH-I515) with standard battery and door; slips right on

--Sides of case have very helpful ridged gripping areas

--Inexpensive

--Camera, power button, volume rocker, and headphone jack cutouts are sized just about perfectly (but not the USB cutout--see below)

Con's:

--Much of the case's external surface is somewhat slippery.  Aside from the ridged lines on the side, and the more textured material of the Android robot logo area, I found the case a little too slippery.

--Although thin, the case ""feels"" like it adds a bit more bulk than I anticipated, and almost seems surprisingly heavy for what should appear to be a lightweight accessory.

--Personal opinion: the large Android robot on the back of the case isn't particularly appropriate in a corporate environment.

--Biggest downside for me (and the real dealbreaker): many USB cables--particularly those with thicker or bulkier connector ends--literally cannot seat fully into the USB port on the phone.  This case's cutout for the USB port is a bit too small for the majority of USB cables I've used on other devices for the past few years, such as an EVO 4G and various bluetooth headsets.

  It's entirely possible the Cruzer Lite TPU case actually provides more protection than the Incipio SA-204 in the event the phone is dropped...  I don't know, and I'm not planning to find out!  Nonetheless, I am *much* more comfortable holding the Galaxy Nexus in the Incipio case as it feels a lot less likely to slip from my grip.","Not Bad, but Not for Silicone Case Users.",1340236800,6.0,,

They have a universal mount which is very similar in design to the Arkon mount but looks much cheaper and costs much more.  This holds my GS3 perfectly and the window mount is solid, doesn't wiggle or bounce around like other car mounts.  One thing of note, unlike the car mounts that have the flexible connector from the suction cup to the mount, this mount does tend to block some of the viewing area for the camera.  If you place the suction cup at a angle and place the phone slightly off center then it doesn't obstruct too much of the camera's viewing area but you may still have some of the mount in your pics/recordings.",Great universal car dock,1343520000,4.0,,

They do cancel the jet noise very very well but as other reviewer mentioned, if someone talks to you or any other ""non constant"" sound comes up, you will hear it, not too loud, but you'll hear it, which is not a bad thing for me, since what I wanted was jet noise cancelling.  And yes, there is a hiss sound but I only hear it when not playing music.

To be honest, I bought these to hear my music that I have on my Blackberry Torch (9800), not for making calls, so what I was looking for was 1: good noise cancelling, 2: comfort fit and 3: great sound.  First two features, I'm totally satisfied, the third one oh well, it might be due to my Blackberry sound power management, but I gotta say that I took the volume to the max and didn't feel it too loud (and no, I'm not deaf, I had 3 previous headsets which I was never able to take the volume to the maximum because the loudness was achieved very easy), BUT, I must say that they handle bass very well (I love bass) even that the headset design is not ""over the ears"" but ""on the ears"".

As for the music controls, I can't say much as these are not fully compatible with Blackberry's music player, so only the ""stop"" button works, but it is not a big deal for me, I just wanted to get rid of cables, cancel jet noise and have decent sound.

They either fall out or they hold in so tight that they break if you try to swap them between vehicles - and even those fall out when you don't want them to; they just won't let go if you want them to.

This has a spring loaded hook to hold onto the back of the vent.  I suppose one caution would be to handle any good vent mount carefully when hooked up because you could break a vent - that would be an expensive proposition. I just use two hands (always stopped and in park!) to adjust the phone.  Loosen the locknut, make your adjustments, and tighten.  The locknut tights from the back to the front so it feels backwards when you adjust it from the front while the mount is hooked up in the car.

First and foremost, if it's solid protection you're after (and if you're prone to dropping your phone) you need a hard case for the iPhone because it's made of glass. It's a great phone functionally, but if you drop it as is, you're done. Many have those slim, trendy skin cases but they will not protect the phone against a drop even if they look cool. Apple and Verizon don't seem to be up front about how delicate the phone is.

I researched cases quite a bit and this one kept coming up. Highly protective, and it fits my Verizon phone perfectly. Make sure you get the UNIVERSAL case for Verizon so it fits. The built in screen protector is crystal clear and DOES NOT LEAVE watermarks or streaks like other cases with a built in screen do.

Now, some caveats:  First, it's a little tricky to put the case on if you attempt it without directions. It's a plastic shell that snaps on and then the hard rubber gets wrapped around it. I strongly suggest you use the web video link that is printed on the inside of the box.  Second, the flap on the bottom for the power jack was a little annoying at first.  It took me a while to figure out how to seal it correctly.  Lastly, this case WILL turn your phone into a brick.  If you want something very slim that will maintain the aesthetics of the phone, this isn't for you, but that's a trade off you have to accept to have hardcore protection. I can fit it in my pocket, but it's a project getting it in and out, and it's a big lint collector.  I'm thinking of trying a slimmer case and risking some protection because the bulk is getting to me.  In summary, a great case for solid protection if you're willing to sacrifice sleekness and aesthetics.",Excellent protective case for Verizon iPhone 4 with some caveats.,1304035200,124.0,,

I got this as a replacement and wouldn't you know the same thing happened to me with this case and the belt clip is fine. I am pretty heafty which is why I guess I have som issues leaving the bathroom. The belt-clip is plastic, and slightly unwieldy for hooking the case on to my belt if my belt is already on, which is the reason I deducted one star, but it is really a 0.25 issue. And I guess my weight doesnt help this issue either, but if this situation comes up I would really recommend taking the 12 seconds to undo your belt and slide the case on that way. The belt clip also clicks when it spins, and though it is clearly meant to hold the phone vertically, it feels relatively solid when it isn't vertical.

The case is a heavy-duty canvas-like material, with stretchy sides. There is a small slot inside that works great for holding an extra battery and that is how I use it. It would not fit the second extra battery and still fit the phone. I've never used the headset strap as shown in the picture. There is another sort of slot on the outside that could probably hold a few credit cards but I've never used it.

The Galaxy S3 is a large phone, and I keep mine in a KaysCase Slim Soft Skin Cover Case and the phone in the semi-rigid case fits into the NiteIze, it slides into the case relatively easily and fits snugly. The phone actually sits with both the power and volume buttons above the stretchy sides. After three days or so it was a easier to attach the magnetic closure strap, but the phone generally feels that it would not slide out even if the magnetic flap wasn't closed. It is pretty comfortable removing the phone, as it sits with the buttons that high there is enough room to grip the sides of the phone to pull it out, but it is not rare for me to inadvertantly adjust the volume but that is more a matter of the phone design than the case design. Carrying the phone inside the case is also comfortable, even though it's vertical I can replace the phone into the case while sitting on my commuter train without elbowing anyone sitting next to me, and if I get a window seat and snuggle in to nap the case with the phone in is not noticeable to keep me from drifting off.

The case is what it is, it is not a premium leather case and therefore it is not as distinguished looking for the boardroom, but it is well made and does everything it is supposed to do well.",For my Samsung Galaxy S3 the NIte Ize fits,1355529600,10.0,,

It has saved my phone many times. I didn't want the bulky Otterbox that was waterproof, so I picked this one. It isn't bulky at all. I love gray and black so I love the colors I picked. They look stylish with my white iPhone.

This is a problem I have with any cover though.
I dropped my phone the day that I put the new commuter case on it out of a 6inch lifted truck with 37's on it. That is quite a high drop to fall from.

I wanted to protect my phone so I started out with CrazyOnDigital's case, after a few days I felt that it was too bulky and found it hard to get in and out of my pocket. I also quickly found that the battery in my S3 just didn't last as long as I needed it. After a full day of work and train ride, it was lucky to make it through the commute home.

With the hope of something that was easier to get out of my pocket, and the ability to add some extra battery time, I began a new search and ended up trying the Hyperion case. When I got it, I felt that it wasn't nearly as protective as my first one, but the extra battery functionality worked well(ish) that it made me decide to keep it... I had a few problems where it would get really hot when charging, and sometimes when plugged in it would charge the case's battery but not the phone itself, so I would wake up with a completely empty battery on my phone, but a fully charged case.

On top of these problems, after a few weeks the battery was only adding about 20 minutes to my casual phone usage. I went to return the thing, but Hyperion's awesome customer service contacted me and offered to send me another one instead. Being decently happy with the device (other than the problems I mentioned) I accepted as they felt a new one wouldn't have the problem. The second one worked better, but after 2 weeks with it, it stopped working completely. At this point, I decided I'd look at if there were any new options, which brings me to my current case.

I've had this for 2 weeks now, and I absolutely and completely am in love with it. The phone fits snuggly in there, and it protects all sides perfectly. The material the case is made of slides easily in and out of your pocket unlike the CrazyOnDigital case. It doesn't get nearly as hot when charging as the Hyperion did. It is much smarter at charging the phone automatically when you plug it in rather than having to make sure you push the ""power"" button on the case to make sure the charge transfers to the phone, which was required with the Hyperion one. I do find that the USB port is not in the easiest place to get a plug into, but that really is my only issue, if you can call it that.

However, there is one huge flaw (keep in mind that this is completely my opinion). The power and volume buttons are EXTREMELY difficult to press.

3.0,True,2012-04-04,A2XI7UD9MWPC0Z,B006GZMWQS,,Ron Perlman,"I bought several of the 10W Wall Chargers for use with iPhones and iPads.  One day I eventually bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/USB-Power-Meter/dp/B00DAR4ITE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">USB Power Meter</a>&nbsp;and tested it's performance.  After testing it, I can not recommend this.  Read ""performance"" for more info.

Size:
From the photo, these appear to be similar in size to the Apple iPhone charger (only 1 Amp.)  They are not.  They are about 50% larger.  This is OK as they are still relatively compact, but in a power strip you won't be able to get them in adjacent outlets.  I tested this in a wall outlets and because wall outlets are spaced further apart than on a power strip, you can just get two of these in to the top and bottom outlet if you flip one over upside down.  This shouldn't be a problem if you're plugging them in to a wall, but I only mention this because I imagined these being a little smaller than they actually are.
The Apple iPad charger is a larger rectangular brick that is designed to stick out more but not obscure adjacent outlet plugs which is a more efficient design.  I'm not sure what Energizer was going for with design, but it seems like form took priority over function.

Folding Prongs:
The plug prongs fold in for travel which is a nice feature.

Performance:
I tested this charge with a genuine Apple USB to 30-pin cable on an iPad 2 and found that I could only draw 1.43 amps (this is a 2.1 amp adapter.)  Running the same test with the genuine Apple 10 watt (2.1 amp) that was included with the iPad 2, I pull 1.87 amps.  Therefore the iPad 2 is still able to rapid charge but it does not perform quite as well as Apple's or other 10 watt adapters.  Not bad, but if it performs about 10% worse, why get it?
The only adapter I've found that actually beats Apple's 10 watt adapter is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PowerGen-Dual-USB-3-1A-15w-Travel-Wall-Charger-with-Swivel-plug-for-Apple-iPad-2-New-iPad-3-iPhone-5-4s-4-3-3Gs-Amazon-Kindle-Fire-HD-DX-KeyBoard-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-USB-Cable-NOT-included-BLACK/dp/B0091XIUKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PowerGen Dual USB 3.1A 15w Travel Wall Charger with Swivel plug for Apple iPad 2, New iPad 3, iPhone 5 4s 4 3 3Gs, Amazon Kindle Fire HD DX KeyBoard, Samsung Galaxy Tab (USB Cable NOT included) - BLACK</a>&nbsp;which is 15 watts, not 10 watts.  With the powergen 15 watt the iPad 2 pulled a maximum of 1.96 amps (my USB tester has a 2 amp limit so it's possible it pulls more if the iPad 2 will allow it.)  Note I did not test the Apple 12 watt adapter and I did not test the iPad 3.

Testing with the iPhone 4S:
The iPhone performs identically to this one as it does with any and all other 5 watt and 10 watt adapters (I've tested 14.)  The iPhone will draw a maximum of 1.03 amps (5 watts) regardless if it's connected to a 5 watt, 10 watt, or 15 watt adapter.  So it's performance is identical on an iPhone.

At the time I originally bought this and wrote the review, there weren't many good alternatives out there and it cost less than Apple's chargers, but Apple's 12 watt adapter is only $19.  I would just buy the real thing with Apple or get the powergen 15 watt dual port (note the 2nd port on the powergen 15 watt will only deliver 2.5 watts to Apple iPhones and iPads so consider it single-port adapter for all intents and purposes.)
Or get something significantly cheaper, but expect the performance to be slightly worse (5%-10% worse than apple's genuine.)",10W Wall Charger I Great,1333497600,30.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DvXIk1KSL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xE8MOfs5L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cp9ZQxfML._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gTBlkw27L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UhEYyEXKL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UWzo7VirL._SY88.jpg']",

The ONLY thing I think missing from this is this does not have the money slot like a traditional wallet, You can however put the money in the inside of the case in that slot with other cards etc. I fit 2 cards in one slot, 2 in the other, then several others including money and my license in that pocket. The case is VERY nice quality and beautifully finished. Feels soft and supple and is just plain nice!!. The magnetic closure closes it well even when stuffed with all the things I put in it. A money slot like in the Manhattan Fonerize wallet would be nice. I do have that Manhattan wallet as well but it's bulkier and the phone is held in place with a leather outlined sheath so the sides at times tend to somewhat block texting a tiny bit in that wallet. This one has the plastic holder glued to the inside back of this Bear Motion wallet which for the record, works beautifully and I don't think scratches the phone as long as you don't take it in and out of the case often. No reason to anyway as I easily talk by folding the front of the wallet back which works perfectly and makes for easy talking and holding. All buttons and connections are easily connectable with the phone in the case. The price is really very reasonable for such a nice case and it's not made from some pho foney plastic vinyl weird smelling stuff like many others are.

While this does solve the problem with the 3.5mm jack, one issue though kept me from giving it 5-stars:  when you have this flipped up to then plug into the jack, the bottom of the phone is then exposed (to scratch, etc.).  The intent of this item (according to the Speck site video) is to address dockability.  So they didn't necessarily intend for it to be used this way.  And in a dock it is not likely to move around much, but I'd still have to believe that even there you're going to end up seeing some scratching on the bottom edge of the phone.  I'm going to try to work around this by taking a piece of foam of some kind and placing it in the bottom of my car's cup holder to give my iPhone something soft to rest on.

So meets the need, but not perfect.  But given that my alternative for years has been to modify the Speck case, this seems to be an improvement over that process.",Meets a Need When Using 3.5mm Cables But....,1350086400,11.0,,
5.0,True,2012-01-08,A2RI4QE6EO29CA,B005U30D9A,,J. F. Hindy,"Before I begin, I want to mention that I base no part of this product review on how fast it shipped to me. That's a seller review, not a product review. However, I had a unique problem with the post office and Cimo was quick to help rectify the problem, even if it took an extra week. The post office's fault, not theirs.

This case is very nice, nicer than I thought it'd be for the price.

1. It fits like a glove. There's no wobble or ""open spots"". The phone sits securely inside of the case with no troubles.

2. It looks better than I envisioned. The clear part is actually clear and you can see even the detail on the back of the case. The cloudy part is clearer than you'd think. The words ""Galaxy S II"" and ""Sprint"" can be clearly read on the back.

3. Doesn't obscure any buttons, any ports, speakers, the camera or the screen. Everything works just fine.

4. Speaking of buttons, I have no trouble pressing any of them (the volume rocker or the power button). No extra effort required at all. I consider that a pro when they're covered up.

I bought this case because when it's bare and sitting on a hard surface (wood, counter top, etc), the vibrate is extremely loud and it worried me. This puts a nice barrier between the phone and the table (which I used to do by just setting it on a book or my wallet). So the vibration is a little quieter, which I consider a good thing because the vibrate on this phone is ridiculous.

If you're one of those types to lay their phones face down, the lip on the front raises the phone off the surface, so there's no way any part of your phone is touching the table (whether it's face down or face up). I never have my phone face down, but I thought it was noteworthy.

The ONLY con, and it's not even bad enough to subtract a star, is that the camera is slightly off center in the case. If you look at it, there's a little phone space on the right border while the left border syncs up to the case just fine. This is purely aesthetic, as it doesn't screw with camera function at all. Since I spend virtually no time with my phone face down and doesn't impede the functionality of the case or the phone, hence no stars removed.

Bottom line, For under $10, this is probably the best case I've ever seen for any device. It's pretty, it's functional, it fits snugly and works as it says it does(which, with phone cases, is all you can ever really ask for). If you're looking for something on the cheap that looks and feels like a more expensive case, pick up this one (I assume the other colors are just the same case...just in different colors, so I assume they'd work just as well).

Thanks for reading :)

**Update**
Something I didn't mention that I didn't really think about during my initial writing. The right and left spines of the case (you know, where you hold it), are textured. It's the same style of texture as the battery door on the phone itself, so people who own the phone already know what that feels like.

This is a serious pro for people who have trouble holding the phone one handed. As the guy who drilled the holes in my bowling ball once said, I have very feminine hands (d'oh!), and the extra grip on the side is immensely helpful in helping me keep a solid one-handed grip when doing stuff like checking notifications or changing songs.

One con I've found is that sometimes, if you're not careful removing the phone, it'll rip the battery door off. Since the door is flimsy plastic, it could cause it to break. I'm not saying take it out with tweezers like your performing surgery, but just be mindful and maybe get a finger back there to hold it on.

Lastly (and then I'm done, I promise), many users, including me, believe the phone feels plasticky and not very durable. While the case probably won't help the phone survive any trips off the top of the Eiffel Tower, I do believe the phone feels more secure than without it and I'm confident the phone can take a 4-6 foot drop onto a hard surface and survive. It doesn't add a lot of girth (barely noticeable, I promise) or weight, but it makes the phone feel...more solid. Makes me miss my Evo 4g a little less :)

The ability to do so much with such a tiny size blows me up. I kinda used impostah to force activate my HP veer and bypassed data plan from at&t thereof since I never wanted data plan on any of my phone. That was the whole reason of not buying phone from AT&T.

Anyways, regarding phone, it is very sweet phone with ability to do a lot. I just wanted a phone, which functions like a normal phone does, but along can do small small things for me (like email checking etc.). I don't want phone to do everything for me as I have so many other things (laptop, desktop, tablets etc etc) to do it from. I wanted my phone to be sweet looking, easy to hold, stylish, and in budget. I bought it from amazon for around 85 bucks and without activating any data plan, it is a steal now. If I had to get a data plan, I would better buy expensive phones (galaxy, BB etc) from att. But this phone is for those who don't want to get into smartphone hassle, but still kind of want something fancy looking and in line with what is nowadays standard touch screen phone.

I am going to enjoy my phone for next couple of years and will only look for new phone thereafter.

It's well built, feels really solid and not cheap at all.  The suction cup for the windshield is nice and heavy duty and doesn't let go in the hot sun the way my garmin will.  The vent clip fits on both my old S70 volvo and my wife's Audi but isn't quite as tight gripped onto the fins of the vent as I would like.  My car has a tighter than stock aftermarket suspension and the phone holder jiggles up and down a little bit making it hard to see.  The windshield mount doesn't do this however and in my wife's car, the vent clip doesn't shake so I just attribute the vibration of the vent clip in my car to the tighter suspension.

The cleaning cloth alone makes the purchase a positive. Also included in the package are a few product cards, lint removal stickers x2, and 3 screen protectors.

Installing the screen protectors was easy enough and the the screen protectors go on almost flawlessly, except for the bottom edges to the left and right of the home button which lifts up. It isn't that big of a deal, and it could be just the one protector that was flawed, but overall, I love the product and blows away any competition at this price level.

***EDIT*** I contacted iSmooth about the screen protector lifting issue around the home button, and they replied saying that the problem has been fixed and they sent me 3 screen protectors from their newest batch free of charge. The new screen protectors are perfect in every way. No lifting issue at all. Excellent customer service, and I would give 10 stars if I could.*******

After initially applying the screen protector, the screen is a little sticking or tacky, but that goes away in just a few minutes of touching the screen.

This meant I had to come back to my hotel and have been sanding the card down for over 30 minutes (doing it very carefully, since after a while you begin to see the IC chip though the plastic on the SIM card), when with my cheaper SIM cutter I'd simply cut, pop the chip in my phone and go.

Individually, it is not the BEST at doing any of the tasks. For example, its noise cancellation is not better than any $100.00 product (Rather, in one of the comaprisons on CNET that I saw, it does not appear among the top 5), and my $5 wired phone headset provides better and reliable phone conversation than these. The music comes out well but most $100.00 headphones will beat it hands down.

So it is not perfect but it is a top one out there in its class of headsets. Of course it is way overpriced at $300.00 but because there are only few decent noise canceling headphones and only couple that also do bluetooth.

One major area of my interest is the noise canceling component. I am a commuter to New York, and struggle my way through trains, subway, long walks through jostling tourists on noisy streets and mostly I listen to audio books so a decent noise canceling capability is a must for me.

In the past I have tried to many times to replace Bose QCs but never found a decent wireless alternative. I have tried bluetooth noise canceling products from Sony, Luvs, and Samsung but found them worthless in subways.

I compared BH-905i with Bose QC15, Sennheiser MM-450 and Nokia BH-905. I found its Noise cancelling about half of QC15 but bettter than more expensive Sennheiser MM-450. Surprisingly, I found BH-905 noise cancelling a notch better. I ran tests standing next to my heating unit, refregierator, walking through boradway during rush hours and a ride through the subway.

Bose QC15 are the best and the greatest as far as ANC but not easy to manage, to wear or stow away. In a cold climate, managing a wired headphone without any controls out of several layers of clothing is at best awkward. But their quality, comfort is great and noise canceling is few notches above their competition. Nokia BH-905i competes with them in every respect but loses in the noise canceling department. So if noise canceling is your main concern, QC15 is a no brainer.

The bluetooth range of Nokia BH-905i is surprisingly good, as well as pairing, connectivity, and most importantly, it reconnects predictably everytime. I have been able to connect to iPad, an Android phone and a Macbook and it does a good job. They don't fit my head very well and fall off when I bend it forward but I can live with that. The audio quality is comparable, if not as good, to Bose's or Sennheiser. Its noise canceling works in most environments like airplance, but fails in more demanding ones like Subway.

However, if noise canceling is not high on your priority list then there are other bluetooth headsets available for one third the price. To justify $300 on these you must be looking for both - a high quality noise canceling as well as bluetooth connectivity.

UPDATE:
I think at $199.00 they are more reasonably priced so I have improved my rating. However, BH-905 at $139.00 is better.",Best bluetooth but not best overall - Noise canceling not as good as Bose QC15,1292371200,15.0,,

Essentially, it is a battery-powered USB charger sized like a typical 7-inch tablet. Its internal Lithium-ion rechargeable battery can be recharged either using the solar panel, or through external USB power port. Once charged, you can then use this unit as a portable charger for other USB-powered devices. The unit also features a powerful 6-LED flood light.

Since I'm an engineer, I just HAVE to open the case to see what's inside. I'm quite impressed by the high-quality components found (see the photo I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section):
- The internal Lithium-ion rechargeable battery is rated 3.7V 4100mAh (the product description says '4000mAh')
- The LEDs are mounted on an aluminum-backed PCB. This is great for thermal dissipation (but you don't see this very often due to high cost)
- The battery charging/discharging operation is controlled by an 8-bit microprocessor (again, you don't see this often due to high cost). This is very important because, without the correct charging algorithm, a Li-ion battery can be easily damaged by over-charging.

I then tested the unit electrically, and found it to work more or less as expected:
- When you recharge the internal battery through a computer USB port, the charging current is at 500mA. This is limited by the current capacity of a standard USB port. So the charge time is around 8-9 hours.
- When charging through an external 5V 1A USB power adapter, the battery charging current increases to 0.69A. That means the charge time is reduced to around 6-7 hours.
- When charging with the solar panel, the highest charging current I can get is ~350mA. This is under optimal test condition of bright summer sun at noon time, with the panel perpendicular to the sunbeam. In real life, it will take at least two full days of direct sunlight to recharge the internal battery. Also note that if you place the solar panel inside your car, the charging current is cut by half because the car window filters out most of the UV light.

Next, I tried to use this Soladec unit to recharge different types of USB-powered devices. The outcome varies according to the power requirement:
- When charging a low-drain USB device (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-GoGear-Aria-MP3-Player/dp/B0024FAC16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips GoGear Aria MP3 Player</a>), the USB device is powered up correctly, but the Soladec's LED indicator light does not cycle to show 'charging in progress'
- When charging a medium-drain USB device (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nintendo-DSi-XL/dp/B002I08UWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nintendo DSi XL</a>), the device is powered up correctly, and the Soladec's LED indicator cycles to show charging in progress.
- When powering a high-drain USB device (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VIZIO-8-Inch-Tablet-VTAB1008/dp/B005B9G79I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VIZIO 8-Inch Tablet VTAB1008</a>), the Soladec's LED indicator still cycles normally, but its output current fluctuates wildly because the maximum current limit is exceeded. This may cause the receiving device to get confused as it constantly enters and then exits charging mode. Actual maximum output current I measured is around 0.81A, even though the product manual says only 0.5A. So at least the product is performing better than specified.
- When ON, the LED light draws 200mA from the battery. This means a runtime of 20 hours. However, I'm skeptical about the advertised light output of '170 lumen', as it requires an amazing efficacy of over 200 lumens per watt.

On the other hand, I have noticed some major design flaws with this Solardec charger:
1. There is no on/off switch. The push button switch beside the LED light does not turn off the whole system, only the light. The system is constantly drawing a 3mA standby current from internal battery. Simple calculation shows that this standby current will drain a 4100mAh battery in less than 2 months. So although the product description says the built-in battery will ""hold a charge for up to 2 years"", in real life you have to recharge it every single month, if you intend to use it in case of emergency.

2. The case is not weather-sealed in any way. In particular, there are no rubber caps for the two USB ports on top. So if it rains, water can easily get in through those openings. That makes it dangerous to leave this solar charger outdoor exposed to direct sunlight. The only safe way is to place it underneath your car's windshield. But doing so also cuts down the solar power by ~50%. So now it takes 4 days to fully recharge the internal battery by solar panel.

CONCLUSION:
The Soladec SD4000LP is a good attempt with quality components inside. But unfortunately, the two major design flaws mentioned above make it less useful either as an emergency power source or as an outdoor solar charger. It does work well as a LED work light, but that can hardly justify its high price tag. That's why I can only give it a 3-star neutral rating, meaning ""It's Okay"".

[Side note on capacity]
Is the capacity of internal battery (4100mAh) sufficient for you? That depends on the USB device you intend to recharge. For example, my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/POLAROID-7-INTERNET-TABLET/dp/B007W2EDAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">POLAROID 7"" INTERNET TABLET</a>&nbsp;has an internal 3000mAh Li-ion battery. So on first glance, the SD4000LP contains more than enough energy to charge up my tablet from empty to 100%. However, the battery charging process has to go though two conversion steps. First, the 3.7V from internal battery is boosted to 5V at the USB port. Next, the 5V is stepped down to around 4V to recharge the tablet battery. Even if each conversion step is 85% efficient, you still lose 30% of energy in the process. That's why you always need 1/3 higher capacity than the device you want to recharge.",Good concept and implementation - except for two major flaws,1339891200,347.0,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61D6yANkfSL._SY88.jpg'],

After using the clear case for a few days, I ran into a few problems including: The buttons were almost impossible to press, especially when docked. The camera flash wouldn't work in the case due to glare. After a couple weeks, the case already looked yellow. I returned that case when I found out that a smoked version was being released.

The Belkin Grip Vue feels great in my hands. It doesn't feel slippery like a plastic case does, but still feels much more solid than a soft silicon skin. It still slides into my pocket easily, but won't slide around a solid surface. It's translucent so you can still see the nice design of the antennae and apple logo. The buttons, especially the power button, are a dream to press. It's almost as easy as if the case wasn't on. And most importantly to me, the flash now works properly. Since the color of the case is much darker, it doesn't show dirt as easily and won't turn yellow like the clear one will. $25 seems like a bargain to me for a name brand case like this. My wife has the purple one and she loves hers as well.

As with most Motorola products, build quality is excellent. The device is extremely slim so it can fit in your skinny jeans next to your phone, but it still packs a huge 4000mAh of battery power. Modern high powered smartphones usually have 1500 to 2000mAh batteries, so this power pack should recharge those twice. The 8W power output is high enough to charge tablets, unlike most lesser devices.

The size is especially surprising. This thing is only 0.3 inch thick. 4000mAh power packs from other brands that I have seen are twice the size and won't easily fit in to your pants pocket like this one. The built-in micro-USB cable is a big feature; you never loose the cable and it does not add any bulk. With most power packs, you have to carry an extra and bulky cable with you, which is likely not going to fit in your pants pocket along with your phone and the charger. I also own a 10000mAh Anker power pack (for multi-day trips) and that is a much larger unit; 3 or 4 times the size of this Motorola when you include the cable.

Some nice features of this device are automatic on/off so the battery won't run down when nothing is attached (as many cheap power packs will). The power test button is recessed into the side of the device so you can't accidentally activate it. A micro-USB cable is conveniently built in to the charger so you can never lose it. If you're charging an oddball device that doesn't use micro-USB, there is also a full-sized USB port so you can plug in your own cable.

Yes, the price is more than what a generic 4000mAh power pack would cost, but I think the you get what you pay for with the quality level and super-thin size. If your smartphone or tablet burns a lot of power (like most 4G devices do these days) and you're going to be away from a wall socket all day and your device doesn't accept spare batteries (an unfortunate trend), then this is a great device to carry with you. You can even charge 2 devices at the same time, which is great way to meet people at the airport :)",best portable power pack that I have ever tried,1353369600,77.0,,

I liked the application via moisture, as it's a much easier install than others that have to be basically applied perfect the first time. There's margin for error on the Armorsuit protectors.

Problem is, I am not a fan of this style of protector. Previously, the units I had used were always rather hard, and felt like glass. Consequently, using the material felt like I had no protector on it at all.

With the Armorsuit, it's made out of a rubbery material, and it feels and looks like it. Sure, the material is clear, so there's no optical problems for use. It's just annoying that it has a bit of a drag feel to it during use, and I can see ripples in the material. It doesn't have as bad an orange peel look as, say, a Zagg protector, but it is there, and it is notable.

5.0,True,2011-10-02,A3SLEXYE6IUXWM,B005O50PPG,,Sarah,"I bought this screen protector for my Droid Bionic the day Steinheil released it.  Here are my thoughts:
Pros:
1. Very easy to apply, but watch the videos online!  It's easier to partially pull back the underneath covering along the side instead of the top to give you more length to ensure you get it on straight.
2. It's clear and slick as glass. I honestly cannot tell it's on in terms of the clarity of the display or the feel of the touchscreen.

Cons:
NONE since SGP fixed a flaw on their first batch (covering the Bionic proximity sensor).  The design being shipped as of early October 2011 is perfect.

You'll still get fingerprints, and they seem to be a bit harder to wipe off the protector than from the glass. I figure this is the price you pay for combining protection from scratches with ZERO distortion of the Bionic's beautiful display.  If you'd rather choose the other side of the tradeoff, don't choose the Ultra Crystal. They also make a shield designed to reduce fingerprints at the cost of slight display distortion (which I haven't used so can't comment on).

But when I got my Galaxy S III, I was determined to find the best case I could to protect the phone and keep it safer (with less chance of slipping) in my hand.  When I saw the reviews for this case, and that purchasers had previously bought other cases from this company, my hopes were high.

Please be assured, I was NOT disappointed!  This is a FANTASTIC case!  Here's some pros:

1. Its thin - So you don't get a big fat phone that now is uncomfortable in your pocket.

2. Its rubberized - So there's no slippage when you hold it which means you are far less likely to drop it.

3. Its VERY high quality - I had placed it just two days ago on the little pad on my car's dashboard which holds the phone in place.  Well, that it did, but being I live in Las Vegas, the little pad had started to melt and some of it transferred to the case!  I thought ""Well, I should have known better"".  But a few rubs of my fingers over the problem area and it was like it was never there!  The case looks brand new again and feels just as it always did.

4. Easy On and Off - I have chargers everywhere, but I still have three extra batteries so when I go out with my kids I can take pictures, send texts, keep the display up high, and not worry.  This means now and then I need to pry off the back cover of the phone.  This cover slips off in an instant and back on just as fast.  Yet it holds tightly to the phone without the least chance of it accidentally coming off.

5. Very Well Designed - The alignment and space given the openings for the various plugs and buttons of the phone are just perfect.  The buttons line up in the middle of each opening and they are all perfectly sized.

I wish there was even one so-so or negative thing I could say so I don't sound like a shill for the company, which I assure you I am not, but as my Title said, its simply the best case I ever had.

It would be very nice to have a way to charge our phones to keep in touch with family. At 25 bucks, I figured it's worth trying.

the unit is roughly the size of a large 5"" smart phone. (Slightly larger than a regular smartphone). It does seem well built, but I know it won't live through a drop from couple feet. This means I need to buy some kind of protection for it since in the HMMV it might get banged around. I'm also afraid if I leave this outside my tent, and it rains. the unit will be ruined. I might put it in a ziploc bag, which could potentially solve that.

Now as far as charging and all that fun stuff....

When I first got it , it was 50% charged. I plugged in my phone and it started charging it fairly quick. I was impressed. I let the device fully charge from the USB port and used it to charge my phone overnight. It worked like a dream. In the morning, but phone was fully charged!

The next day I put it outside to see the solar charging panel (why I got it) and I have to say from about 12pm-5pm I got only 25% out of it. It only charged my phone 10% before it died.

I tried again today and I got 50% out of it in the sun. I will let my phone drain some more, and plug it in tonight to see how much it charges, but I'm a little upset that from 7am to 4pm I got only 50% charge from the sun outside. I was hoping that timeframe would be enough to fully charge the thing.

So I can't say it will fulfill my needs, but I will take it with me to test. If it fails in the field, I will return it.

The reason I rate it 3 stars is because it sort of fails in the solar performance category, and this is what this item is for.

Update - 11/12:

It would never get a full charge in the sun (left for HOURS) out in the field, so I gave up and. I had a chance to charge it via USB, I did that instead, so it ended up being like a e battery charger. I would charge it on USB then go charge my phone later on the field. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone mainly because it fails in the solar category. but it does hold a charge well enough to get about 1.5 charges on a Samsung galaxy 3.

I had no trouble removing the sticker from it's backing, nor did I have trouble with things lining up in front, like the keyboard buttons and such.  There are no bubbles anywhere.

All holes fit Dell Streak dead on. Would ""probably"" prevent some damage in a drop to a hard surface. Seems the only reported damage weakness to Dell Streak is compression (i.e., reference a review on their site); not sure of that unfortunate user had a case, but I'm sure he didn't have the Otterbox.

Also, interestingly... the interior of this case has hundreds upon hundreds of cut-out squares (approximately 1/8""x 1/8"" max) equally spaced, in an apparent effort to allow for heat dissipation, weight reduction(?), or perhaps compression absorption (?)(upon impact). Nevertheless, the hundreds of concave square cut-outs have absolutely no negative impact on the cover's use, and probably increase the functionality of one or more of the above issues (i.e., heat movement, weight loss or absorption of compression stress after an impact).

Whatever the squares do (or don't do), I love this case.

Androids, lg's, samsungs, every nokia (except the n8 and n9 - no keyboards) and I keep praying that one will be the one. This e6 is it so far, even with the most serious Nokia problem ever.

why? because so many other things have been fixed - but not all.

I will try to list all issues with e6 especially as compared to older e72, e63, n97, n97mini, e7, astound (c7)

This e6 does have Anna from factory. Only 8gb of internal mem. SDhc slot. Ultra fast boot up, screen shows main screen in about 10 seconds, tho it does continue to load more in background such as bluetooth and wireless (wifi) connection. Very handy since you will experience random reboots (biggest problem ever! with any nokia!) Reboots happen most often when using the gps and phone is not mounted in a shockproof mount!

Dont mistake the shockproof mount as the quality of the phone is superb as usual for nokia. This phone is by far the most useful phone ever made; especially from nokia.

Main reasons this phone is the most useful:
Speed - menus are almost instant!
Change screens -instant!
Email eyecandy is finally tolerable!
menu key is instant!
 Stupid bug if you don't properly complete the factory setup questions, gives error everytime you start it complaining it cant find setup wizard which just dissappears quickly.

Best parts of this phone:
FAST
Not windows, not ios, not android!
Has almost all the google software as separate apps like maps and email!! Awesome.
independent browser! Works awesome! (minus the pinch to zoom, which I hate. The volume controls do not operate the zoom-lame.)
More space to hold phone at bottom beneath keyboard!
directional nav key!
No optical thumb dumb thingy as 'new' phones use - so no headaches in useability!
Full capacitive touch screen which adds ultimate in efficient and speedy usability!
nearly all touch buttons are intelligently sized and positioned!
Full 3.5g speeds! (10mbs approx!)
Tmobile full support, with free internet programability! No high speed data 'tax' (ie blackberry plan etc)
Yes, I have it on my phoneweb plan for $10!
Awesome nokia browser
very very good email program including full mail for exchange imap support (but only one mail for exchange acct :  with speed keys for navigation!
Intelligent contact manager AND calendar - fast very efficient and most useful as compared to any 'new' smartphone!
Very intelligent navigation - when done in one app such as looking at a calendar event by pressing calendar key inside of contacts, it will take you back to where you were - in the contact! AWESOME
very bright dual leds for flash and flashlight.

Full keyboard, but space bar removes some needed keys as it is too wide! E72 keyboard was much better.

Main problems with this phone:
Random reboots when in motion outside of fixed location  when driving, biking etc) mainly when using gps/music, but does happen with nothing other than mail for exchange / email on homescreens
CAMERA SUCKS for important pics! IT is fast, but there is NO Auto Focus! the N97 cameras kill this P.o.s.
tight camera lock slide, grinds plastic after several days of constant use.
phone auto locks after phone call is disconnected even if you are in the middle of typing a calendar event/contact etc (retarded)
Phone still beeps annoyingly when other end of call hangs up before you do, I have been told over and over again that this is because of tmobile, um but this is an unlocked phone right ? so where is the setting??? Nokia? Do you ever listen??? No. Cause you are so awesome with your $6 stock price right?

Go Stephan Elop! (nokia ceo)

Best Business phone EVER. So incredibly sad that I have to plan on it rebooting while driving. Good thing it reboots in 10 seconds, almost fully in 15 seconds!

Burke,"I'd been stuck with a Droid X on another big carrier for nearly 2 years and my X started acting wacky, and since the X was out of warranty my options were to buy an expensive upgrade or walk away from it. Since I had Virgin Mobile phones for my wife and kid I took the leap and walked. Happy I did.

I'd gotten my wife an Optimus Elite a few weeks before and it is definitely a nice little phone for the price, and was thinking about getting one for myself, but I was leaning towards going the power route and getting the Evo V 4G. Luckily - just in time, as they just came out - I ran across the HTC One V first. After a bit of research and weighing the options, I decided that I was tired of carrying around big, bulky phones, and that I really didn't need the extra power and capability the Evo has, so I picked up a One V. I don't talk much, use texting more, so the $35/month plan fits me perfectly, and at that price and for only $200 up front this is a steal. Now, to the phone itself...

It is a very compact phone, very light, yet does not at all feel cheap. No plastic backing, this one has a real aluminum unibody that both looks and feels great and offers much better protection than cheaper plastic units. It has Gorilla Glass on the screen as well, so right out of the box this phone is more solidly constructed than most of the competition. I dropped it my second day (my hands still being used to gripping a big-screened monstrosity) and it took quite a tumble before it hit the floor, picked it up and brushed it off, not a scratch and kept walking. It has a no frills appearance to it that I find aesthetically pleasing as well. Slides right in and out of the pocket, don't even notice it's there. I like that coming from a big phone that you have to struggle with to get out of the pocket.

The screen is nice and vibrant. Not the best out there but it is crisp and very responsive, with every indication of quality. Decent viewing angles. I find the 3.7"" just small enough to still be easily usable and easy to type on, and still big enough for some gaming and video. Big screens are nice for those things, but I think they hit the sweet spot with 3.7"" - big enough but not so big as to make the phone itself too big.

The ICS operating system is very smooth, noticeably more refined (and simpler, once you get used to it) than previous versions. I don't even care if this phone ever gets Jelly Bean or not, I am perfectly happy with ICS. App compatability has been very good so far - nearly every app I had loaded on the X (and every single one I use regularly) works fine on this one, which is surprising since this one is so new.

Under the hood this one has similar specs to what my Droid X had: a 1Ghz Snapdragon processor and 512MB of RAM. Higher end phones nowadays are sporting dual and even quad core processors paired with 1GB of RAM, but really, what do you need that for? Pretty much newer graphically intense gaming, which I don't really do with my phone (I have an Acer Iconia Tab A100 for that). I do light gaming on the phone, and for that this works just fine (although even this one will play many of the higher end games like Shadowgun, it's just not as smooth as the S3s of the world). As for other apps the hardware in the One V runs everything just fine with very little to no lag, so I'm not missing those extra cores and extra RAM. Note that if you intend to do serious gaming on your phone then this one is not for you, but if you are just a casual phone gamer then this works just fine.

The GPS is possibly the brightest spot on this phone - it is simply phenomenal. I toggle the GPS on, hop into GPS Status and *immediately* acquire 8 satellites - indoors. Then open maps and see that it has located me to within about 3-5 meters. I sometimes had to wait up to 5 minutes for my Droid X to get a position, this one took about 5 seconds.

The camera is not bad at all. The Droid X had an 8MP camera, this one a 5MP camera, and I can't tell the difference in quality. It does, however, have a neat little function where you can hold down the shutter button for a few seconds and it takes multiple pics rapidly, and lets you pick the one you want to keep. This is VERY handy for capturing stills of moving targets. Also, there is little to no shutter lag, which also helps.

Battery life has been pretty good so far. After about 10 hours at work doing some browsing, light gaming, some tunes, fiddling with GPS a bit, and no recharging I get home with anywhere from 20-40% remaining. That is perfectly adequate for me.

Cell reception seems to be quite good for me so far. I get decent 3G signal and download speed even when walking in an underground train tunnel and in areas where other big carrier phones don't. I had expected worse from a no-contract carrier, but am pleasantly surprised. I understand this will vary greatly depending upon location, but where I live it is very good. Call quality has also been good on both ends.

Wifi and Bluetooth work fine. I was even able to tether my tablet using FoxFi and run it off of Bluetooth... To save my data plan I turn on Wifi whenever I have access (like as soon as I get home). The 3G is for when I am out and about, and I should have no problem bumping up against VM's throttle limit of 2.5GB of data. That would only really be a problem if one was streaming lots of video or music, which I don't do.

So, in conclusion, is this a top of the line phone? No, if you want that then you will get a contract with a big carrier, and you will pay alot for it. For me, and I suspect for most users out there, this phone does what I need it to do, and it does it well. If the Galaxy S3 is top of the line, and say a Droid Razr is runner up, then this one would place third. But I am factoring the cost into my evaluation, and the cost for a One V from VM is *much* less than those types of phones, and you get a platform that does pretty much the same stuff for the vast majority of users out there. And the monthly bill is far easier to swallow. Even if you get the $55/month unlimited everything plan and add the $5 insurance (worth it IMO) it's still far less than you will be paying on any smartphone contract. As an example, our 2 smartphone contract with the old carrier with 700 minutes cost us just under $200/month, while 3 smartphones with VM with 1800 minutes total cost us $120/month. More phones + more minutes + lower monthly cost = Win every day of the week.

And one of the best things: you are not stuck with this phone. Phones become obsolete quickly, generally long before the 2 years is up on contract. About a year into the contract you're sitting there fiddling with your phone looking at the cool new stuff everyone is playing with and thinking ""Oh great, I'm stuck with this thing for another year..."". You have no easy ability to upgrade; you either pay a huge penalty to do so or you are just stuck with what you have, which will certainly be obsolete after the first year. With these you can just toss the phone and upgrade easily any time you want, and the new phones aren't that expensive. That is probably my favorite feature of all.

So if you are in the market for a decent no-contract phone and don't need the bells and whistles of the Evo or want it's size and bulk, this is a fantastic choice. The phone itself is not a 5 star phone, I'd give it 3.5-4 stars in today's environment - but realistically that is perfectly fine for 95% of the users out there. Most people do not actually need the uber-cool hardware of the latest release, they just need something that works, and this one does. Factoring in the cost and the flexibility of going off-contract is what gets it to 5 stars. And if you are looking at the Optimus Elite I'd recommend considering the One V; it's worth the extra $50. The OE is a nice little phone and worth its price, but this one is better; my wife is already bugging me to get her one...

Oh, and BTW - Otterbox already has a case out for these, and it is great. Amazon has them, too.

UPDATE: So, been running this phone for a few weeks now, and I am still liking it alot. A few comments:

Battery: most Android phones take a week or two to learn the user's patterns and optimize themselves, and this one is no exception. During the first week or so I had some days where it almost died on me, but now it knows me and is sipping juice. It's not abnormal for me to get home with close to 50% battery left now, which is quite good, I think. The inability to remove the battery will not be an issue, as by the time this battery goes bad (they all do eventually) this phone will be obsolete and it will be time to replace it anyway. Tough it out through those first couple of weeks and you won't be disappointed in this battery.

OS: ICS is running very smooth. I had a couple of FCs at first but as with the battery, it smoothed itself out and is running nearly to perfection now. App compatibility is still phenomenal for a relatively new phone.

Cell signal: During the first week I had 3-4 instances where the phone lost 3G signal, but I don't fault it much as I was deep within a heavy metal structure building and buried under lots of concrete. It hasn't happened since, and when it did it found the signal again within a minute, so not exactly a big deal. I have since traveled across state (TX, a big one) and found cell reception / 3G to be quite good pretty much everywhere. I never noticed any areas where I couldn't get a signal. Running on Sprint's network I didn't expect any problems in this area, and haven't really found any; they have a very well developed network and their expansion is ongoing. Also, as more people move onto 4G networks it makes 3G easier to ride.

GPS: the GPS continues to impress me. It isn't always immediate as in my first review, but it is always fairly fast (generally less than 20 seconds for multiple satellite lock). It is most definitely a real GPS, too, and not just some AGPS tomfoolery. It works fine in Airplane Mode and where there is no cell signal... Just know that you will need preloaded maps or have one downloaded via Wifi for it to be of any use if you are going out of network (there are several good apps to do this with, I personally like MapDroyd and Backcountry Navigator Pro, respectively, for their given applications).

Camera: I am still liking the camera, too. When trying to snap photos of moving objects/people just hold the shutter button down until it's passed and then select the pic you want to keep - very handy function. The quality is not great, but not bad either. Perfectly acceptable for a phone camera. The only issue I have with the camera is the zoom - not very good there. But fine for anything close up.

The wife is bugging me every day now to get her one, don't think I'll be able to hold off much longer. Taken as a whole, this phone and the plan price tag is a fantastic value, and it does everything I need it to do. Still highly recommended.

Oh, and Trident now has a nice looking case out for these. They are generally on par with Otterbox and offer another alternative. Mine will continue to wear the Otterbox for now, as I am happy with it.

UPDATE 2: After uninstalling a few apps, I am now coming home with 60% battery or so. I NEVER came close to that with the X. I took off some widget apps and just run with the stock weather/clock widget (which is actually pretty good), took off Sonic 4 Ep 1 and the Alarm Clock app, and voila! One or more of those apps was running in the background; the phone also doesn't get hot anymore unless I am REALLY pushing it... It is smooth as silk now.

I can't say enough about this phone, or the fact that it only costs me $40 a month with insurance.

UPDATE 3: After a couple of months I finally broke down and got the wife one. Ordered a Trident case for it. Like I said in the earlier review, one of the great things about these no contract phones is you can upgrade anytime you want. So the wife upgrades from the Optimus Elite to the One V, and the kid gets to upgrade from an Optimus V to an Optimus Elite. Everyone wins.

And mine is still running great. It's probably the most problem-free smartphone I've seen so far. Still highly recommend it.

UPDATE 4: Quick status update, it's New Year's, 2013, and this phone is still going strong for both me and the wife. Still a great deal, especially at the prices it's been selling at lately. I bought it for twice what it's selling at now... I'd do it all over again at the original price. That is how happy I've been with the phone.

UPDATE 5: All good things must come to an end. One of the great things about the VM line is that it's easy to upgrade whenever you want to since you're not on contract. I tried out an EVO V 4G for awhile, and it's a decent phone, but I've finally found the sweet spot with the Samsung Galaxy Victory 4G LTE. It is using Sprint's 4G LTE and it's simply a quantum leap forward. Price point is not bad at all either, and it's on sale right now for less than I paid for my One V...

The One V was a great phone, it did everything I needed and functioned well. But the future lies in 4G LTE networks. Jump on VM's next big ship and take a ride, you won't be disappointed.",For the price an excellent phone,1342051200,507.0,,

But, and for me its a big but, the reason I keep dropping my phone is because the case won't stay on my belt, every time I sit in a chair and get up, it comes undone and falls to the floor.  As I walk around, it works its way lose and falls.  I am afraid I am not going to hear it fall and will lose my phone.  At first I thought it was because my belt was too thick so I got a thinner one and it doesnt matter.

Another issue I have is that I have to disassemble the whole case to remove my memory card.  This is more a design limitation of the phone though, and I guess most people don't use their phones the way I do and so the card stays put, but it is something to consider if you plan on removing the card frequently.

It doesn't interfere with the look of the phone, but the ridges on the sides make it a lot easier to hold. The material comes up just a little on the front, protecting the screen from scratches if you set it face down. The whole thing is translucent enough to show the blue through the 'clear' part and you can still read the 'Galaxy S III' and provider name through the white part.

The cons are somewhat minor. The buttons are hard to push, but not so much because of the stiffness of the case. Mostly they are hard to find - there is a small notch where the white and clear meet on the side, which your finger will naturally find and push when looking for the power button. (Unfortunately, it is about .5cm above the actual button.) If you are on the right spot, it pushes pretty easily.

The other issue is that my car charger (from an old palm device) doesn't fit - the case opening is very close to the USB jack. The stock charger fits fine though, being flatter. (I suspect other cables will be an issue if they aren't exceptionally flat.)

I bought a couple of similar cases, and this one is my favourite so far.

When i first opened the package it reminded me of a hearing aid.  I decided to give it a try and from the first 5 minutes I was hooked.  The sound quality is excellent and I am able to have two phones connected at the same time.  I am not sure you understand what that means.. That means I can get an alert from my iphone while I am on a call with my blackberry at the same time.  Sure my jawbone was able to pair with two phones at the same time, but it used to fight over which phone was the primary.

I wear glasses and really had my doubts about the over the ear design, but it was not an issue at all.  The headset is so light i forgot I was wearing it.  The ear bud basically just fits in your ear and is very comfortable.  I could only go 2 hours with my jawbone before my ear would start to hurt... This guy i can keep in all day.

The other nice thing I liked about this headset was that you could move the boom mic up and down.  This made it very easy for people to tell if I was on a phone call or not, especially those long conference calls when most of the time I am on mute.

Besides the design and tech aspects of the headset, what really won me over was the mute button during a call.  It is so easy to click the button to mute instead of fishing for my phone in the car or in my pocket.  Having dedicated volume rocker as well is pretty awesome.  Connecting to phones is much much faster then my jawbones.

Anything Bad? Yes!  Be aware that the power plug is a magnet that snaps onto the headset.  The magnet isn't the strongest and if you have this plugged in your car and you drive, it will pop off and go on the floor.  I can understand why they went this route because I am sure there are no more broken micro or mini usb ports to fix or rma due to this connector, but it is not convenient.

So to recap...

-Very Light
-Comfort design for those with glasses
-Great battery life and features
-Can be connected to two phones at the same time and you hear alerts from both phones
-Has a dedicated volume rocker
-Has a mute button during calls
-Has bad recharge/computer usb connector system

The dock is a simple yet elegant design that holds the phone at about a 65-70 degree angle which is perfect for viewing. The cable included, although only a USB cable and not a DC cable is still very nice, durable and will connect to any DC-USB plug. I picked up a few locally for quite cheap and plugged them in. The base is sturdy and the connection to the phone is snug but the phone does wobble a tad when the base is used. Considering this is a charging and docking base I don't see this as a major problem. My own phone sits nicely without any case or skin and my wife's phone which has a snap-on cover still fits well without any issue whatsoever. Another great feature of this affordable dock is that you can sit your phone on it in landscape mode since it offers extra room in front of the micro-usb connection for the phone.

One of the huge benefits over other units is that this one is more ""universal"" in design meaning you can turn the micro-usb connection around should you need to use it for a phone that has a port facing the opposite direction.

Pros:
Stylish
Sturdy
Stable
Samsung Galaxy SII can fit with or without a case attached
Phone sits nicely in portrait or landscape without any issue
Since the charge/dock unit uses a micro-usb you can pretty much use it with any other phone, not just a Samsung i9100 so this unit will come in handy when you upgrade to a new phone!

It's true that the top and bottom surface, which are soft rubber, will collect (and show) a little bit of lint, and it's also true that the kickstand initially wouldn't move all the way into the correct position (just about perpendicular to the case) until I carefully scraped a little bit of excess matte-rubber coating from the little tab that's supposed to lock it into place.  But I have to say, these are insignificant relative to my really strong satisfaction with the design and ergonomic feel of the case, both in and out of my pocket, all day long.

Vehicle: Ford Explorer Sport Trac
Phone: Samsung Nexus S with a Platinum Series case from Best Buy
The construction quality is excellent. All components feel solid to me.
Installation of the Vent mount went fairly smoothly. I wish it were a bit more flexible in how it attached to the vent, but it works. I have mine mounted on the left center vent on my 2002 Ford Explorer Sport Trac. It is a little bit close to the gear shift lever, but does not interfere with it's use as far as I can tell (shifting between Park, Reverse, and Drive caused no problems).
the holder grabs onto the phone and holds it very securely. The bottom feet are difficult to move, but stay put and have just enough adjustment to make it easy to accommodate just about any connections you need to make on the bottom of your phone. In the event that the feet aren't able to be moved enough, you can remove them, and the grips on the side will hold the phone perfectly fine. The location of the grips on the side is good for my Nexus S, as they are just below the Volume buttons on the left, and well below the power button on the right. One thing that wasn't entirely obvious from the pictures is that you can switch the bottom feet to the top of if you need, so you could in theory turn the holder upside down to modify where the grips hold the phone a bit. The connections between the holder and the vent mount are solid. The only issue I have with it so far (only had it installed on two legs of my commute so far) is that when a phone is not installed in it (I don't usually use my phone on my morning commute) it tends to shake and make a bit of noise. Not a lot, but it's noticeable. There are no such noises when a phone is installed.

I do not regret my choice, because I think I picked the best one out there.  I just wish there was something a little better.
It took me over an hour to install.  It's unwieldy and a little heavy (which is fine - this thing seems built to stop a very big dog from ruining your back seat, and I suspect it would), and I thought a lot of pieces were missing initially.  Turns out the thing comes partially assembled, just to mess with you (?).
I finally wrangled it into the trunk area and was admiring my hard work when I realized something - THIS THING FITS BETTER UPSIDE-DOWN IN SOME CARS.  The angled top corners actually left enough space between the barrier and the windows for my smaller dog to fit her head through and destroy my upholstery.  So I took it out, flipped it upside down, and re-installed it.  Another 20 minutes later, I was once again done.  Now, it works fantastically.
My two biggest problems with this thing are the eventual metallic-jingling sound it makes as it shortens over time.  To keep it silent, one would have to readjust it about once a month.  My second problem with it is how difficult it is to install.  I HATE taking it out, because I dread the time I'm going to waste putting it back in.  It's awkward to adjust and tighten the legs and close to (but not quite) impossible to accomplish alone.
****Subaru owners****** - The ""foot"" of the barrier will hit where the middle seat's shoulder belt comes out of the car ceiling!!!  If your car has a ceiling-stored shoulder belt, there's a good chance it will interfere with the installation of this thing.  It still stays put, but the ""foot"" isn't angled, and it hits on an angled part of the ceiling.  Not as stable as I would have liked, but it stays put with monthly adjustments.
Also, it's definitely scarred the interior on the car's carpeted ceiling.  There's nothing anyone could do about that, and I'd rather have two circular scars on my ceiling than my backseat ruined by my dogs.
**OVERALL: Worth the price, does the job it says it will, adjusts to fit basically any size interior, will likely interfere with a middle seat shoulder belt (if it comes out of the ceiling, as in Subarus), won't fall over if installed right, might scar your car's ceiling, will need ~monthly re-tightenings, and is generally a pain in the ass to take in and out.","Does the Job, If It's Upside Down",1355788800,48.0,,

The case is pretty well made, although a little odd to install. I think you can just stuff your phone in it like so, but I was confused and ended up putting the rubbery part of it on the phone first, then slide it into the hard plastic piece. All the cutouts for the buttons and connection ports are cut out correctly, and are protected by their own individual flap. It does add a little bulk to the phone, but that's what you have to be willing to trade off for decent protection. The case feels nice in my hand, and it's a lot better than TPU cases. TPU cases are thinner and more sleek, but they won't protect heavy drops. Also, because I have a rare condition that causes excessive sweating of the hands (palmar hyperhidrosis), this case doesn't trigger it as much as TPU cases, so it's less likely that the phone will fly out of my hand due to slipping.

Since there's no Otterbox cases for this phone (or at least from what I can find on Google), this is about the best you can get. I'm sure there are a few hardcore cases out there I didn't see, but I'm not ""that guy"" who has OCD and has to have the best protection.

First of all, I had an N8 Nokia phone which I loved (mainly for the camera and GPS navigation), but had enough draw backs with the OS (Symbian) that I started looking else where for my next phone.

I evaluated carefully this phone for a month and decided to keep it, at the end.

The phone is crazy fast (changing between screen, menus, apps, etc.), the OS (Android Gingerbread) is really smooth and friendly.

The resolution is amazing.

The 5.1 sound is really nice (saw a movie with this option ON, and it sounded great).

Internet browsing is as fluid as with a PC.

There are TOO many apps, so you'll have a lot of fun with that.

One issue that a heard before was the battery life, so my test and results are these:
* 3G ON, Wifi ON, Sync ON, Notification ON: 8 - 10 hours
* 3G OFF, Wifi ON, Sync ON, Notification ON: 20-24 hours
* 3G OFF, Wifi OFF, Sync OFF, Notification OFF (only turning data ON when needed): 36 - 40 hours.

So in my case, it really depends on how much time 3G is ON and how my personal configuration (data sync) was set. In my opinion, this is not a problem at all.

Camera is great (even compared to the N8).

Video is great.

GPS is good, but not great (I miss the Ovi Maps ... which, at this point, would like them to sell their software). Google Maps won't do without data (or at least won't work efficiently). Bought CoPilot and the result is average, but at least it was cheap (around 10 dollars).

Tested (successfully 3G) with the following carriers:
* AT&T (U.S.)
* Telcel (Mexico)

Of course, if I compare any of these features with the N8, the difference is enormous, but the real rival is the iPhone. So I tried my wife iPhone4 for a while, so I could get a better perspective. And I'm sorry to say (to Android fans ... or Apple fans, for that matter) that between these two, it totally depends on taste or the one that you actually own.

I wouldn't trade this phone for an iPhone, and my wife wouldn't trade her iPhone for my GS2 (but we both thought that the other ones phone seemed really great), so you see, I guess what I can resume from this is that both phones are really good ... the details, well it depends on the user, I guess.

Anyways, really fast, fun and time consuming.

So overall, really happy with the phone.

Oh yeah, before I forget, one important fact (for some, I'm guessing), although I'm a tekkie and might ROOT and put some special ROM on the phone at some point (just for kicks), the review and my final opinion is on the phone as sold, so I wouldn't go and say that these android phones are only for geeks/tekkies.

I did a practice run before removing any protective sheets above or below the screen protector. Also, I applied it from the middle of the phone first, and then smoothened it outwards towards both left and right of the center line. That  helped avoid the bubbles.
The display of the phone is very bright and clear through this screen protector.
The only two drawbacks are that it is hard to wipe fingerprints from this protective sheet, and second is that when the phone is not powered on, you can see an oily film kind of reflection from the screen protector.

The clear case fits the white iPhone 4 perfectly. All buttons and connectors are easily accessible (except the Sim card slot which hopefully no one needs to access :-) ). Looks well built and better than many expensive cases.

The case fits the phone like a glove and looks about as good as a piece of plastic covering your phone is going to look (I also really like the Diztronic logo).  My only complaints are 1. grip 2. cutouts instead of button covers.

1. I think many people are under the impression that matte is ""grippier"" than ""glossy"" finishes.  That is actually the exact opposite.  Matte TPU cases are actually rather slippery (more slippery than the original back cover of the GSIII.  This particular case only has grip at the top edges (which are glossy) while the rest of the case is matte and rather slippery.  If there had been a smoke, gel version of this case I would have bought it instead.

2. This is subjective, but I prefer cases which cover the buttons instead of leaving them exposed with cutouts.  Yes, the buttons are slightly harder to press, but I find this to be a good thing since I often accidentally hit the volume buttons.

It died... the speaker would cut-out so I couldn't hear the caller but the mic continued to work . (my other BT headsets work fine).  May get another one looking to see what else is available.

I have tried the Jawbone (original, Icon, Era), Plantronics (Discovery 925 & 975, Voyager Pro, Pro HD, Marque M155, M100), Sound ID (forget the model, Motorola (H17, H12) and many many more - Only the Jawbone Icon worked well but they (yes plural) would break within 6 mos by generating an irritating sound my callers would hear (sounded like loud rushing wind).  After having done Aliph Jawbone returns twice (not the easiest company to deal with) I gave up on the Jawbone line in search for something else.

I spent many many hours over days trying to find the bluetooth headset that:
 * would NOT cut my voice off, make it sound like a robot or muffled
 * have good sounding clear loud speaker (I have some hearing loss)
 * A2DP - I can stream audio, listen to podcasts, nav directions, etc.
 * excellent noise cancellation (I drive a Honda Fit - not a quite car ride)

I believe the Motorola HX550 is a winner. It just works and works well (iPhone 4S).  My only complaint is that Siri's voice is really loud and there is no way that I have found to reduce the volume of her announcements (had this problem with the Marque M155 as well).

I was really skeptical of buying this unit because:

* I never thought Motorola made good BT headsets
* it was only ~$50 delivered

However, the Moto HX550 really delivers and the fit is very secure and comfortable.  I didn't think I would like the folding mic boom but it is really convenient for stowing and doubles as power switch for the unit.  It pairs fast and connects in less the 2 secs (from off) with my iPhone.  Thinking of actually using it while I exercise as an option to have wireless music (yes it sounds that good and loud - no bass of course).

I read the specs before purchasing and it says that it lasts much longer than the Samsung Infuse, my previous phone, but NOT even close! For example, I'd charge the battery on Samsung NOTE to full capacity until around noon or so and then by 6 or 7pm the battery indicator is already in the red! This is barely surfing or talking.  I never had a problem like this with my Infuse or my Samsung S2, my current phone.

2. You can't create Ymail on the default android email account!! I didn't have this problem with Infuse or my current S2! I had to have 3 different email apps with the NOTE to see all my emails.  I have over 10 different email accounts such as Yahoo, Rocketmail, Ymail and Gmails.  So this is really inconvenient compared to my former phone Infuse!

3. You can't turn off the loud clicking/shutter sound when taking pictures or Video recording! Again, there's no such problems with the Samsung Infuse or S2?? I like to have some privacy when taking pictures of the black board or the overhead screen projection during my class room lecture or meetings. This is really ridiculous!

In summary, if you pay over $700 for a phone then it shouldn't have the problems I mentioned. Why is it that the less expensive phone can do more or give you more? It's illogical! I returned/sold the NOTE after having it for 5 days.  I hated the thought of paying so much for a phone and getting less than my previous Samsung Infuse which I sold for only $300. I now own Samsung S2 and love it! Also, I can create all email accounts onto just one app. (NOTE: Samsung S2 AT&T version allows Ymail but not the Samsung S2 i9100 International version)  The only good thing about the NOTE is that the screen size is perfect for me.

When my company offered me an iPhone or a Blackberry, I jumped at the chance for a ""free"" iPhone and like everyone else who has one, dealt with the short battery life as just a given.  It was frustrating having come from a number of phones, the last one an LG Dare, that had excellent batt life, in fact it was one of the main things I looked for.

Moving on to now having/loving my iPhone: as a parent and employee I couldn't have my phone run out of juice if I forgot to plug it in one night, and started the search for a good back-up power supply. Like most the sharp buyers on Amazon, I sort my results by 4+ star ratings and then sort further by highest rating and then read, read, read.  The Trent came up either highest on the list or in the top few for backup power supplies, and I liked that it wasn't good for an extra hour or two, but for what... TWENTY hours? More? Didn't seem possible, but I did use it for a weekend to see how long I could watch movies on flights from NY to Chicago and back, etc... and I couldn't be happier.

I don't know if I lost the power cord for recharging, or it wasn't in the box (maybe my preschooler flushed it?), but their customer service was excellent and they're sending a replacement in time for my flight to Ireland so I can watch movies on the long flight and have my iPhone available for work during all day, or multiple-day trips while aboard.  Maybe you only need an extra hour or two, but for not much more weight/size/expense, you could have 10x that amount of power.

The 3.2 inch screen is bright and vivid. Although it is by no means cramped, the screen is a bit on the smaller side. Swype is nice once you get used to it, but I still prefer a regular keyboard to swiping. Quite surprisingly, I made very few mistakes while typing in portrait mode, and I have large-medium sized hands. I use landscape mode most of the time for typing, though, where the keys are much larger.

The stock Android 2.2 (READ: no overlay interface) is very user-friendly. I have used many mobile OSes, and I would have to say that Android is probably my favorite. Plus, the Optimus One series are all being updated to 2.3, so let's hope Virgin gives us the 2.3 update.

The network/3G data speeds are normally very fast and the call quality is great as well (no dropped calls... Yet). Virgin uses Sprint's cell towers/network for data and voice service, but, unlike Sprint phones, Virgin cannot roam on to other CDMA carriers like Verizon. That means that if you leave a Sprint area, you are stuck without service until you reenter a Sprint coverage area. Before buying, make sure you live in an area that Virgin reaches (you can check on their website)

The phone's 600Mhz processor sounds slow in comparison to newer phones, yet it handles multitasking and all of my apps just fine with the occasional slowdown. Speaking of apps, there are plenty available on the Android Market.

I also have a 2000 Toyota Sienna, and it won't work on the A/C vents.  But it does work fine on the windshield.  The one problem with the windshield is that in California I believe it's technically illegal to put anything on the windshield. However, the windshield in the Toyota is so big and long that it doesn't interfere with your view of the road.

The hard plastic back has small bumps and ridges which make the phone less slippery. For people with big hands, like my husband, this case makes the phone easier to grip. He feels the top on/off button is much easier to find and opperate with this case in place.

You may have heard that the HTC Titan has some issues with the sound quality. Phone calls are not as loud or clear as people would like them to be. This has nothing to do with the case - or any cover such as this one. I've heard there is a noise-canceling software loaded into the device (as of fall 2011). Unfortunately this software is making sound quality low or muffled. I believe the phone manufacturer is looking for a fix for this. Expect a software patch.

I only bring this up in this review because I don't want people blaming the case. It's a good one and I recommend it.

One downside is being able to shut off the shutdown tone (was able to download Silent Boot app for booting up silently) and that the mobile won't autostart with an alarm set (found out this was not available on Android OS). Apparently one can root the OS to change the shutdown tone (Linux users will recognise this function) but I don't want to void any warranty at this point.

Samsung mobile phones that I have owned have been consistently very good to excellent (the others were Java-based mobiles). Samsung support was informative when I asked them about the auto-start with the alarm.

I had contacted Amazon about the activation kit being included when I read another reviewer's post to verify, but unfortunately the chat agent told me the wrong information (said that there was not an activation kit inlcuded).

This is a very attractive stand, well-suited for nesting a smartphone for video calling, or multimedia player. The cable management holes in the back work as well for audio cables as for charge/sync cables. In this review, you'll see that I replaced their small sticker on the backrest with a iPod Nano screen protector to give a bit more soft surface area for whatever I put on the stand.

I did a ton of mini-system research and ultimately decided on this system. It was the best overall value and the output is outrageous! The upper range is crystal clear and mid-range voices sound good. I really don't see the need for a sub in my 12x14 office. I find the bass adequate and very natural.

My review about this product: it really polished any glass
I used it on my iPod 2nd. Gen.and function as intended,
but there are things to consider.
-Its not recommended on touch screen
-You can't see instant result on the first application
-You must apply 3-4 times to see the polishing result
-A little force is required to apply the compound
-Circular motion when rubbing to achieved best result
-Apply small amount on scratches
-Requires 4 times/more rubbing to remove deep scratch
-Avoid to much rubbing since this is a rubbing compound
 it will make any surface thinner.
-Avoid using it on metal surface of your ipod/Itouch

CONS:
-Quantity is just small and you may run out of
 compound specially applying on large surface.
-This compound may removed the scratch but actually
it will damage the surface but you will not able to
see it because its only noticeable seeing it in a
microscope, that is why its not recommended using
it in a touch screen devices.

I recommend using this product on non-touch
screen devices and you need patience in
applying this one, its not a magic compound.

Get a screen protector with these replacement screens, as the Apple installed oleophobic coating was not on either of the replacements I dealt with.

I did a little research to see how to determine an OEM part vs a cheap knock off, and found that the OEM parts say Apple on the digitizer and LCD ribbon cables; on my (better) replacement screen, the LCD cable does say Apple, but the digitizer cable does not. Also, if the metal backing of the LCD has a nice mirror finish (after pulling off the blue protective plastic, you'll likely be happier than if it doesn't.

I don't like it, and I'm not using it. It was a waste of money.

Update
Am currently using an Otterbox Defender. It's got better coverage, offers much better purchase of the phone (which makes typing easier) and it looks pretty good. Unfortunately, issues with the screen protector are serious: the protector doesn't fit flush against the phone screen and it's a fingerprint/oil collector.

Initially I had difficulty figuring out the charge indicator since it didn't have instructions but I finally decoded it: if it's charging, it turns a pinkish red color and once it is completely charged it turns blue.

Instead of getting an extended battery, I decided to buy multiple standard batteries (as in about 6 total batteries). This way I always have a power source and I don't have to deal with a charger cord while playing with my phone, texting, etc. Another good thing about this option is that it keeps the charger port of the phone fresh and tight. Anyone who has had the same phone for a year or more will see that, eventually, the charger port gets loose and stops charging correctly or you have to have something holding the cord in place as it charges.

The negative to this method is that you have to take the battery cover off on a regular basis and if you're not careful, you can break the prongs off the cover and/or have a piece break off into the phone.

Anyway, this charger is cheaply made but it does the job. Just remember red is charging and blue is charged. It is slow to charge but if you have extra batteries, that's not really an issue.

I wouldn't recommend this to a friend without explaining all these things to that person so that they knew what they were getting.

By the way, here are two great cases/covers that come off quickly and easily to take off battery cover. I have used both for over a month and they provide great protection yet come of in a few seconds. Also, no plastic prongs to worry about snapping off and ruining the case. Thank me later:

As many have already stated, the plug and 'goose neck' have a hard time handling the weight of these new smart phones. It does not want to remain in place when used in a more vertical mounting, such as in my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee, however I was somewhat prepared for this. I am going to install a separate power socket on the dash nearer to the driver's side, and make a small bracket to attach the upper part of the mount to the dash to support the weight. It will make it slightly less portable, but I primarily bought it for use in this vehicle.

The actual phone mount is what I had hope for. It fits my Galaxy S T-959 with the OEM gel case very well and appears to hold it tightly. The kit supplied the correct USB cable to connect to the phone for charging (it's plenty long so I left it coiled and tied). The 3.5mm plug for the audio should be a 90 degree plug, but it's not bad. Both USB plugs that go to the transmitter  and the top of the phone should also be molded 90 degrees as this would present a cleaner look, but again, it's not bad as is.

The audio quality is good for the price. Pandora sounds as good as any FM station. The music I have stored also sounds good, although I do hear a bit of 'white noise' when there is no music playing. I really like the phone call audio piped through the car speakers, the sound quality is good and is much easier to control the volume using the radio volume control. You can hear some beeps or clicks when calling into the mounted phone, but this may be due to the bouncing of the power plug in the socket when driving causing intermittent power drops. The support bracket I will make may solve this.

If this were a $150 unit, I would expect none of the above issues or needed modifications, however for $19 shipped in, even with the minor mods for support, this is not too bad of a deal.

Update, Sept. 9, 2012: Having used this now for about 9 months, I am still pleased with my purchase. The 'white noise' appears to happen when the USB cable is attached and the phone's battery is fully charged, if I disconnect the USB cable the noise goes away. As one of the other reviewers noted, the audio volume does seem a bit weak. I have to turn the phones volume to max and even then need to turn the radio volume up a bit more than if I was listening to the radio or CD player. About 5 months into use, the power indicator LED began to flicker, now it is mainly not working, but that is a minor inconvenience.

It is not as obnoxious looking as some of the other ones, it has a futuristic design and had good reviews.  It wasn't the cheapest, but at $79, it was not overly pricey either.  Plus you get to choose from some hip colors if you are into that sort of thing.  I stuck with black.

It paired with and connected to my Droid X2 effortlessly.  I was surprised to hear a voice prompt saying ""connected."" I use this primarily in my car while my phone is in the car dock. I have not used many different features on it, but on the calls I used it , sound was clear and loud enough (volume level controlled by the phone), and the parties I was talking to never complained about clarity or asked me to repeat what I said, even when the window was rolled down and when there was considerable wind noise in the car.  So far I have been pretty happy with it.

My few problems with it are: (1) The charger plug is difficult to pull out of a tight outlet because it's shaped like a shallow cylinder with not much grip. (2) Base is not that easy to handle because of its shape and can roll around in the car pretty easily. (3) The only button on the headset is not easily found or reachable when the unit is in your ear. Your earlobe covers it. (4) Not as secure in your ear if you are walking since it lacks a loop around the earlobe.  There are two ear gel pieces that come with it, so may be one would be better than the other for it to remain in your ear.  I would not recommend this one if you are looking to use this during any physical activity, however. (5) It may be difficult to find the correct orientation to place it in since it has a triangular shape; you have to pay attention to which way you are putting it in your ear.

But I had an accident with the one that I reviewed here in 2009, so I decided to see what other Plantronics Bluetooth headsets were available.

Picked up this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plantronics-Voyager-520-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B001DETCUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset</a>&nbsp;as it had been recommended by a friend as a reasonably priced alternative, which it is.  It's certainly better than my older Motorola H500-series Bluetooth headsets, but not quite in the same league as the Plantronics Voyager PRO series, and for a number of reasons.

Likes:

+ Very simple setup and pairing; couldn't be easier
+ Excellent battery life; easily meets 8 hours of talk time
+ Comfortable earloop; swivels to fit either ear
+ Excellent and clearly written instructions
+ Works with Skype through the computer
+ Good one-button controls

Compromises:

* Wind noise higher than expected; oyager PRO series is far better
* Moderate noise cancellation; Voyager PRO series is far better
* Claimed range of ""up to 33 feet"" was rare

Dislikes:

- High static levels; annoying to parties on the other end
- Proprietary plug on the charger; should be a standard Micro USB
- Junky plastic desk charging cradle; not worthy of the Plantronics name
- Soft plastic separated on the earloop; had to fix with SuperGlue, more than once

Regular Use:

As noted in the beginning, this was picked up as reasonably priced alternative to the Plantronics Voyager PRO series. I'm neutral on the design of this Voyager 520, though the chrome look could have been muted and not so glitzy, but it was the ability to communicate and sometimes for extended periods that was important. In that, this headset
did well except for the occasional high static levels experienced, where none had been there with the older Voyager PRO (and more on this later).

But... the two-piece ear loop separated and had to be glued together, and this had to be done a few times. Once I lost the soft plastic part for a couple of days and luckily found it. The last time, I cleaned both parts carefully with isopropyl alcohol before using the SuperGlue, and so far it has held. This is apparently a common problem as I found on the Plantronics site when I went to see if they had a tech solution. Plantronics needs to go back to the drawing board on this.

But my biggest complaint is that this Plantronics Voyager 520 requires a proprietary plug for charging in a world that has gone to Micro USB plugs. In fact, the Plantronics Voyager PRO HD, Voyager PRO+, Discovery 975, Savor M1100, M100, and even their discontinued Explorer 240, 360 and 390 all use the universal Micro USB plugs for charging, so why should this model be different?  Plantronics needs to work on their charging connector.

It may not matter that much, but note that this Plantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset is listed here as Item model number: 75859-01. On the Plantronics site, it's listed as P/N: 75859-01, and according to them,  the ""Product is Discontinued"" so be aware of that.

All this being said, I moved on to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plantronics-Voyager-PRO-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B0043EV20G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headset</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, and like it's earlier PRO series sibling it's a 5-star offering. The Voyager 520 has been set aside as a backup, and so far it hasn't been needed.

4.0,True,2011-08-08,A12DGMEUT0QO15,B005CZ03LO,,RobG,"OK, here's the good, the bad, and the ugly with this case.

Good:

1) This case is never going to accidentally ""let go"" from your belt due to the aggressive clip used.  If you're concerned about that, this is the case for you!
2) Magnetic cover is nice -- the phone is secured inside and it's trivial to get to the phone when you want it.
3) The phone can be easily turned/rotated so that it doesn't have to be straight up.
4) Case provides nice extra padding/protection.
5) It's inexpensive!
6) You can put a thin rubber protective skin on the phone and it will still fit reasonably well in this case.  It's a little snug but workable.

Bad:

1) The aggressive clip design with the high tension spring to secure it means that it will take some work to get this case off your belt.  One side of the spring loaded clip is behind and nearly flat with the back of the case so you can't just reach behind the clip to provide pressure on both sides of it so that it will release.  (Other vertical phone holders I've had made this easy).  There are other ways around the problem such as rotating the phone on the clip so you have easier access to the clip or using two fingers to brace against the top of the rigid back or simply taking the phone out of the pouch every time before you take the pouch off your belt.  This isn't the end of the world but the clip could have been designed so it didn't have this issue.

Other thoughts:

1) The phone is a little loose in the case without a protective skin on the phone but it's not bad and not going to hurt anything.
2) I'm concerned that the magnetic case if placed on or near my wallet when on my desk at night might damage the magnetic stripes on my credit cards.

Edit after a number of months of use:

This case is holding up very well, no scratches or any signs of wear.  The phone seems well protected too -- no incidents there.  With a skin on the phone it fits perfectly in this case.  Without one it would likely slide around a bit.  The clip design is still a bit wonky (-1 star for that) but I'm upping my rating to 4 stars to reflect this update.",Not bad but the clip could use a little redesign,1312761600,16.0,,
4.0,True,2010-01-04,A2UEB48LAWFUCW,B0013A7KMW,,Joseph91,"This is Motorola's phone designed for emerging markets.  A great value for the price, it's a durable, reliable phone, but it doesn't do much else.  I bought this to ride out the last two months in my AT&T contract, and it has worked fine.

I would rate at at 4 stars FOR THIS PRICE POINT.  At the price, my only real complaints are that I would like more characters on the screen and would like better support for handsfree.

Pros:

1) Price:  You will not be able to find an unlocked phone anywhere near this price.  If you did, it wouldn't be nearly as good at what it does.

2) Durability: This phone is tough.  Not many moving parts, no fancy operating system, solid integrated keys.

3) Phone: It makes phone calls well.  The sound is good, the reception is good, the speakerphone is good.  Its alarm and clock functions are fine, its internal phonebook is weak but functional, and it can text in an emergency.

4) Minimalism:  There is a certain sexy minimalism about a sleek black phone that doesn't do *anything* except make phone calls.

Cons:

1) Texting and phonebook are weak.  The phone's display is ""e-ink"", and is limited to 2 lines of 6 characters at a time. (It looks like you are reading a calculator).  If you don't mind scrolling through 12 letters at a time, it's possible to text, but it's not easy.  I wouldn't use this phone to send or receive texts except in an emergency.  Similarly, there is a basic phonebook, but once you store more than a few dozen numbers, it's hard to get much use out of it.

2) Handsfree is limited.  The speakerphone is great.  Unfortunately, without bluetooth, you can't use wireless headsets, and even wireline headsets are hard to find because of the custom combination headphone/power jack.

3) No other features.  No GPS.  No graphics.  No games.  No videos, MP3s, ringtone downloads, camera, or any of the other doodads we take for granted.

Tips:

1) Some people have complained that their phone won't activate touchtone menus.  My phone will activate touch-tone menus, but only in speakerphone mode.  When I'm not in speakerphone, menus won't recognize my tones.

2) The documentation is minimal.  If you google, Motorola has a much better manual available for download, and there are also a number of unpublished programming codes.

Update: According to exhaustive googling, the touch-tone problem can be fixed, temporarily, by pulling the battery for 10 seconds to reset the basic settings.  This has worked for me - from time to time, touch-tone stops working on automated menus.

I've used them with tablets in the past and they worked rather well. First, the materials appear to be rather nice. Just holding the case it feels well built, descent grip, not slippery, and even has an almost leather-like odor to it. Not bad at all.

And because the back/front and 4 corners are covered, you even have a descent amount of protection. This leaves all of the buttons and ports easily accessible. The case is nice and sturdy, and as a result, does add some noticeably bulk, easily doubling the thickness. But you can see that from the pictures. No surprises there. It has all of the expected openings for phone, mic, and even the stylus. Although it is a tad trickier to get to the stylus since the cut-out isn't as big as would like. Could be an issues for larger fingers.

However, out of the box, the phone didn't quite fit all that well in the case. I had to bend the 4 grips just so that it would stop popping out so much. Now it's much better, but not as ""tight"" as I would like it to be. It's not going to fall out or anything. And at least the phone is very easy to take in and out of the case. The cover and leather covered clasp both fit and work very well. With a little practice, you can even open it with one hand.

The ""convertible"" portion works as expected. Just flip it up and set it in landscape mode and away you go. It has an indention to help keep it propped up in one angle. Although because this phone is so light, I've found you can pretty much put it in any angle you want. And with the new design they have, you no longer have to partially remove it from it's holder to do this.

The big issue I have is that there is no indention in the cover for the front Home button. So anytime there is pressure applied to the front of the case, the button is pressed and the phone is turned on. So if it's in a pocket, bag, or if you just happen to squeeze a at the wrong spot, you could have some issues. That's a pretty big oversight in my mind.

Also as mentioned above, the new convertible design that allows you to easily switch to landscape mode, also means there is much less support for the cover when it's open. Meaning it'll move around a lot more when not securely closed. Not a big deal, but worth noting.

PROS:
+ New more efficient convertible case design
+ Good quality materials
+ Moderate phone protection
+ Nice feel & ergonomics
+ Easy case removal
+ Cheap!

CONS:
- Poor fitment out of the box
- No home button indention
- Loose cover when open
- Small cut-out for stylus

Overall, when you take into consideration it's form, functionality, and especially price, it's really not bad.

Well made, securely fits on the phone, total access to all buttons as well as having a permanent and touch sensitive protection screen. Everything I could ever want to protect my phone except for one glaring problem.  I am totally unable to plug my Iphone into either of my docking/speaker stations.  Two different manufacturers - no accessibility.

The problem is exactly the reason why this cover is so good. Because it has multiple layers of protection, it is bulkier rather than slimmer.  So therefore you cannot just slip it into a station and have it work.  Unless I want to keep taking the cover off everytime I want to play my music throughout my home (which I do not believe is an adviseable solution), than I had no choice but to return this cover and buy something else a little sleeker.

Oh and one more small but subjective issue. If you have small hands like I do, it can be a little awkward holding the covered Iphone in your hand.  Not a deal breaker by any means, but just something to be aware of.

4.0,True,2010-05-18,A1GYYOE13EFKKW,B0038L495U,,team W,"I spent a bunch of time reading reviews of various iPhone FM transmitters before buying this one.  I've used it now for several weeks, so it seems only fair for me to pass on my views since I relied on these user reviews so much in selecting the product in the first place.

(1) The sound quality does seem better than other FM transmitters I've tried.  I let it find a frequency and tuned the radio to it, and haven't had any interference, ghosting etc.  I live in Washington DC and have found other FM transmitters just have too much interference to work effectively.  So far, this gets full marks on sound quality, which is probably the most important issue to think about when buying one of these things.  (If you haven't used FM transmitters before - understand one thing: the FCC limits the power output of these little transmitters to the point that they can be easily overwhelmed by interference, static, distant real radio stations, etc. - so finding one that actually works and puts out a strong enough signal to work effectively is really not easy.  This one does manage it.)

(2) The mount does hold the phone securely and it is relatively easy to take the phone in and out of.

(3) The little dongle cord to plug the phone in is kind of klutzy.  Basically, you have to plug the base of the phone into the dongle, then squeeze the arms that hold the phone together, every time you put the phone in the mount.  It would be better to just drop the phone into the mount with a pre-set plug, then squeeze the arms together, but this is a fairly trivial issue.  The other annoying thing about the dongle is that because it is loose, if you don't drop the phone in and connect it, it swings freely and knocks against other parts of the transmitter as you drive.  You are basically compelled to hook up your phone every time.

(4) The plug going into the cigarette lighter holds the whole thing VERY securely.  In fact, it holds so securely that I can't even get it out of the lighter plug.  I think I would have to force it to pull it out, and I fear I'd break the whole thing if I pulled on it that hard.  So, whether you intend it or not, this may be a permanent mount for you.

(5) I like how the screen can pivot on the phone and still hold securely.  Depending on your car layout, this means you could use the mount for passengers to watch videos on the iPhone screen.

(6) The gooseneck seems sturdy enough.  I am sure it will break eventually with hard use, but it should hold up for a reasonable period of time.

(7) If I had more problems finding a working station, it would annoy me that the frequency read-out on the thing is on the top of the mount instead of somewhere on the front, where I could easily read it.  Since I haven't had any issues with the station it selected for me initially, I can't really ding the thing seriously for that.

Note: my car does have blue-tooth for the phone, so I haven't even tried the speakerphone thing.  The only thing I can say about that is that it requires you to plug a little cable into the headphone jack AND plug in the dongle to make that work, which is a pretty inelegant solution.  I'd think you'd be better off with a bluetooth headset vs this rather klutzy set-up, but look to other reviews if this is important to you.

Bottom Line: If your car doesn't have a tape deck and you don't want to spend $100s paying somebody to take your dashboard apart to give you an auxiliary input port in your car, this is a reasonable choice.  It's not a perfect product, but it gets the job done.  I don't regret buying it, even though it seems to be permanently stuck in my cigarette lighter.

Both call quality and signal reception seem adequate. The sound quality when playing music is very good (especially with BeatsAudio enabled) although I find the volume to be a bit too high even on the lowest setting especially in a quiet environment. I've informed HTC of this and they will hopefully address it. I also like to ability to control the music player from a locked screen but just wish that the album art would be displayed in a larger size (like in the HTC Wildfire S). I've bugged HTC about this as well so here's to hoping!

Battery life also seems good. After a few hours of music playing and some app/web activity it was still past half full. I'm however skeptical of the ""embedded"" nature of the battery. And this is the main reason for just the 4 stars rating. This means that once the battery degrades (and they all do) you'll probably have to have HTC replace it or chuck the phone. However, chances are that by then you'll probably want to upgrade anyway.

If you're coming from Android 2.3.x (as most of users are) it will take a bit to get adjusted to Android 4.x. Most things are still where you'd expect them to be but subtle changes are throughout. Most notable the Search and Settings buttons are gone and instead there's a ""Recent Apps"" button which also acts as Settings button for apps. To search however you'll need to touch a screen widget.

I'm upgrading from a HTC Wildfire S so here are my thoughts relative to that.

1. Improved app storage space (900MB instead of 150MB) makes it easier to install apps without having to resort to tricks: App2SD, Link2SD or rooting the phone. I'm quite irked that spec list 4GB as the storage space but really 900MB are truly available to use. Also, unlike other phones it does not come with any microSD card but you can add one up to 32GB in size and have a lot of room for songs, pictures, videos.

2. Improved screen (800x480) is crisp and with good colors

3. True FM Radio is still there but again HTC's own radio widget does not work (use Spirit FM instead)

4. Processor speed is also improved (I can now stream Netflix and use Skype over WiFi without a problem)

Voice dialing works great without training which is suprising since I have a very strong Oklahoma accent.
The screen looks great for a $99 smartphone. Some reviewers forget that most mobile providers subsidize their prices, so the price they paid does not reflect the cost of Hi-Def screens.
I have not tried any apps out other than what was included with the phone, but this device was suprisingly free of bloatware. The music player sounds rather good with headphones, which is suprising with very few controls.

I have used the product on soft, thin to thick African-American hair which has been damaged by salons and some due to health issues. My opinion is that the product is excellent. It provides a measuring tool to allow the user to determine the strength to mix for mild to coarse hair; each relaxer base is premeasured and in individual containers; and a bottle of activator; also the 20 box contained a bottle of protectant to reduce the chance of overlapping. My experience is that the product has not produced burning or scabbing or over-processing or breakage.  After relaxing, the hair does not feel dry or brittle. I am very satisfied with the products and have used for over two years.

UPDATE APRIL 20, 2012
Well, I discovered vast difference in supplies. The product is still high quality and the same, however...In the 20 application a measuring tube for the activator is included. In the 4 application, IT IS NOT. In addition, the 20 application contained all labeled bottles (activator, protector). In the 4 application, there was one unmarked, unlabeled bottle of pink liquid, which I knew to be the activator, but a new user would not.

It would be a lot more helpful and professional looking to include the measuring container and labeled, printed bottle of activator.  Therefore I have lowered my review to 2 stars. Not based on product effectiveness, but the 4 application lacks clarity and direction.  This would be totally useless to a first time user.  Even after using the product for such a long time, I went to some leftover product to check that the activator was indeed pink and that it was not the protector. The 4 app is cost effective but only for repeat users.","Tried it, Liked it, Love it",1330992000,8.0,,

I got this in the slot and tightened the nylon/plastic bolt and popped my iphone and and was very happy with it. It tilts and swivels in every direction by a little (enough for my purposes) and it is easy to tilt yet it stays in place. However, when adjusting it on the 3rd time I used it the mount had worked its way out of the CD slot. I was not pulling on it that hard or anything so I was surprised. I tightened it more but think I am at the limits as some plastic started to strip from the bolt (I think see photos) and the top and bottom halves of the wedge look like they are coming apart a bit.  At this tightness I am sure I could still pull it out but I am not going to try because I feel I may have worn the threads to the point that I will not be able to reset it a 2nd time. Now when I adgust the tilt I push in as I do it just to make sure it won't work its way out.
It has minor wobbles on an average road but I am happy with the stability I just don't have a lot of confidence that I can take it out and put it back often (i.e. if you wanted to use it in different cars or wanted to move it to use the CD player which I never will)). I think I have a pretty standard CD slot so I am a little disappointed that it is not better suited to it.
Also the bottom support snaps off in a way that makes me feel like I am breaking it. It is really shallow and phones in cases won't sit on there so well and in fact it will block the dock connector if the phone were resting on it. Fortunately this is not needed- the side clamps hold the phone very securely. The bottom support is nice for keeping the connector handy but still not necessary.
I do find the button you squeeze to release the phone a bit hard to reach while the phone is in there (and this is another time I have to be careful not to put any outward pressure on the mount that might make it come out of the slot again.) I am kinda short though so maybe it is just me...
I have never tried any of the suction mounts at least not since my first ipod, but I will never trust them to stay on and allow me to interact with a touch screen which this mount does do. SO it has a few flaws but think it is on of the better ones out there in this price range.",Better than other options...,1309737600,2.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QE46JPJPL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fBUL8KzuL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KAYHMJjOL._SY88.jpg']",

5.0,True,2012-06-30,A17ZD28PWK3CDB,B003ADBQN4,,Ggersty,"Having never performed a repair like this before I did a ton of research before getting started. Watched a bunch of you tube videos on how to, read reviews on the various repair kits on amazon and from other online sellers, and looked at the tools for the job. I eventually decided on this repair kit as it was well reviewed by many other users and was much cheaper than some of the maybe more reputable online venders like Zeetron.com. Many reviewers said that the included screw driver was terrible so I went to home depot.com and found an excellent mini screw driver set with 4 different Philips head sizes (Husky 8-in-1 slotted/Phillips set for $6). Online the iPhone screw size was reported as #00 but I found the #000 worked best. Did not like the screw driver included in the repair kit and did not attempt to use it as stripping the little screws would have been a disaster. With my tools and kit I set out to do the repair. I pulled up one of the many you tube tube videos to guide me through the repair. The whole job took about an hour although I took it very slowly so as not to damage my phone. The most challenging part was definitely removing the old broken glass and the adhesive holding it in. Also removing the adhesive backs from the new double sided adhesive strips provided in the kit after installing the down side in the phone was also challenging. Let me stop here and say that the terminology of the iPhone parts is a bit confusing and that may be the reason for some of the poor reviews this product has received. Seems that most of people who gave poor reviews did not understand what they were buying and what the repair would entail. This kit is for the glass and digitizer. There is no real feasible way to replace just the glass and at this price what would be the point. I do not even think you can buy the glass and digitizer separately. Many sites refer to this part as the ""glass"" or ""digitizer"" but rest assured the part you are buying contains both. The presence of the little electric cable sticking out the bottom of the glass in the online pictures tells you so. Replacing just the glass/digitizer is definitely most cost effective but also the most difficult way to replace the glass. For the faint of heart I believe you can by the glass/digitizer installed in a mid frame assembly negating the need to remove the glass from the mid frame yourself. More $ for this. Finally for the totally simple repair you can buy complete replacement for the iPhone glass assembly which includes glass/digitizer, mid frame, and LCD. This only requires taking out 2 screws and detaching/re-attaching the 3 cables that go from the screen to the body of the phone. More $$$ for this.

With patience and good preparation this repair went smoothly and was quite satisfying to do.

At the end I had a working iPhone with the repair costing me $12 including the mini screw driver set I am sure I will use many times again in the future. The repair at my local phone repair store would have cost me $60 + tax. Not a bad deal!

Pros:
Kit exactly as described on Amazon
Worked great from the initial install
Great kit if you understand the part you are ordering and what is required for its installation

Cons:
Bad screw driver - buy your own #00 and/or #000 Phillips for the job
Getting the backs off the adhesive strips was tough - pull tabs with no adhesive under would have been helpful

It was a Standby case with magnetic to sleep. For some reason when I applied that case to my Nexus 7, at times the screen would become unresponsive. I would click & press on stuff, & it would not respond. I would really have to press hard or a couple of times just to get certain actions to work properly, it was almost as if I had to press things like it was a physical key. It made my Tablet expression more difficult than easy, breezy. So, with this new tablet, it seemed like everything just started to work Amazing.

It does what it says it will. It offers a solid top surface for sticking my car mount. It opens up to fit inside a cup holder.

My cup holders are not perfect for it though. The cup holders in my minivan have rubberized grips that are designed to secure almost any size cup, small to large. But they don't allow this cup holder to be tightly fitted inside. The rubber grips have to allow for removal of cups so in that same sense, they allow for this (no matter how large I make it) to also slip up and down a little.

This is a dock. Just like the iPhone dock, you put your phone in it, hook up a charging cable, and it charges. It's not a speaker. Nowhere ever did it suggest it was. There is no speaker built-in, and no line out. You set your phone in it, that's it. If you're looking for it to do something else, move along.

For the dock itself, it's actually very high quality. It's got the look and feel of something you might expect Samsung themselves to put out, albeit probably heavier.

Though the Era is far from perfect, I've been pretty happy with it.

After using the Bose for a few weeks, and also doing some head-to-head (no pun intended) testing against the Era when the replacement arrived, I ended up returning the Bose and keeping the Era.  However, it was a very difficult decision.

In terms of comfort, it was pretty much a tie (though I use a Plantronics 975 eargel on the Era... if I were comparing against the stock Jawbone eargels, the Bose would win easily).  The Bose was comfortable, but I did have a some irritation at the spot where the eargel protrudes into the ear canal slightly... switching back and forth between the standard medium eargel and the smaller one, I came to the conclusion that what I really needed was something in between the two.  But again, I generally found it to be comfortable (I ended up sticking with the medium).  It felt secure in my ear, not giving the impression that it was about to fall out.

For sound quality, I'd say the Bose wins in most categories.  Incoming audio was sufficiently loud and clear (in fact, I easily listened to an audiobook during a school field trip while riding on a bus with a bunch of screaming kids).  Outgoing audio was good on both headsets, but while the Era was better in a noise ""torture test"" scenario, the Bose sounded better for more realistic and common situations (sitting at my desk, driving on the Interstate, etc.).  I'd describe the Era's outgoing sound as being more ""full"" than the Bose, but the Bose sound was clearer and more intelligible.

In the end, I determined that there wasn't a big enough difference in sound quality between the two to overcome my main criticism of the Bose, a relatively lackluster feature set.  Specifically, the relatively imprecise battery life indication of the Bose seems downright primitive compared to the Era's voice announcements and on-screen iPhone meter.  Additionally, the Bose does not have the ability to turn off A2DP, which means all alerts and OS sounds on the iPhone go through the headset (which is problematic when the headset is on but not worn)... the Era gives the option of disabling A2DP.  However, I really consider this to be more of an iPhone fault... the iPhone should have the option of disabling A2DP (or let the user specify whether OS sounds should be routed to the headset or to the phone's speaker), so it's not fair to count this against the Bose headset.  Still, the Era compensates for this iPhone missing feature, and I wish the Bose did as well.

But all this being said, I really liked the Bose... I think if I had purchased it and the Era at the same time (and had the option of returning the loser for a full refund), I would have kept the Bose.  But the better sound quality of the Bose was not quite enough to overcome the lack of a good battery life indicator and the expense of keeping it and selling the Era for a big loss.

One big caveat though.  I have an iPhone 4... if I had upgraded to the iPhone 4S, there's no question that I would have kept the Bose, as it is clear that it would work much better with Siri (the Era's voice prompts ""get in the way"" of the user's interaction with Siri).","Great sound quality, but some missing features",1323648000,12.0,,

It takes control of the voice command features in the phone and accesses the contacts list and helps Siri do her job. Have fun.

A follow up. This is a great product. There is no discomfort at all as the earpiece is not at all noticeable. I use it when I am driving, when I am up on the ladder, In the tractor (with the bose Q15 over them to cancel much of the ambient noise). I even get to listen to my music. Now they need only to figure how to deliver stereo through one ear.

Additional followup. The mesh started to come off, seems when I had it in my pocket the mesh rubbed against something and was cut across the edge and peeled up. I cut it by the other edge and now there is no mesh on the end piece. I reread the reviews to see what I had missed and the mesh coming separated seems to be a common occurrence. The manufacturers need to address this as it makes for some concern. I'm sure some folks have not purchased because of this criticism. Had I noted it I might have not bought it. However, that said, it still works fine and I intend to keep using it and am hoping that it will not make any difference to the sound quality.",So much out there.,1345680000,3.0,,
3.0,True,2010-04-04,A54LDOK42IASU,B0012YZQ9I,,S. Cudjoe,"I lost my bluetooth and despite the cheap price that I bought it at, I am going to try the Motorola Bluetooth H710 headset and see how that works.

First let us start with the pros.

Pros:
1. Inexpensive
2. The ear hook can be removed to accomodate either left or right ear
3. Small and easy to carry
4. Sound quality is great for the person I am talking to
5. Well built
6. Battery lasts a long time
7. No blinding light, I personally like that
8. Comfortable on my ear, easy to forget I am have it on

Cons:
1. I cannot go further than maybe 6 or 7 feet from the bluetooth.  It crackles the further you go away from it but at 7 or more feet it is nothing but crackling.
2. I cannot walk with my phone in my pocket, or purse because it will crackle.  I have to either have my phone in front of me while sitting or hold the phone close to the bluetooth.
3. The volume cannot be adjusted to hear others well.  The person can hear me clearly but unfortunately they may sound very far away to me.
4. At first the ear bud was not comfortable because it is hard and the pressure hurt but over time it didn't bother me anymore.
5. Sometimes the headset would automatically disconnect and reconnect during a phone call.  Rare but it did happen.  It is annoying because I would realize I cannot hear the person only to find out that the blue tooth disconnected.
6. Sometimes the headset disconnected and reconnected in my purse even though the blue tooth is next to the phone.  The only problem this caused is that my phone automatically unlocks when this happens so it has accidentally called a few people.  Based on the distance it will disconnect but that is expected, it will reconnect once it's in range.

Based on the price this bluetooth is a great buy.  This is my first bluetooth so I am uncertain if the problems I have are common amongst even the more expensive buys. I enjoyed the handsfree option and that is why I am getting another bluetooth.  My only aggrevation was the few times it called someone or when I am talking and I had to put the phone to my hear because the blue tooth disconnected.  Sometimes it was a pain to reconnect the blue tooth, not sure if that a phone problem or not.  I liked the size of the blue tooth and I would recommend it if you are on a tight budget.",It does it's job,1270339200,2.0,,

The exposed side felt smooth, and never got hung up on anything.  The phone clicked in with a very definate action, so I never felt like it might fall out due to incorrect insertion.  Very trouble free.

When I bought the iPhone 4s, I really wanted to find a holster that replicated the great experience I'd been having with the 3Gs holster.  After looking at several in the store, and online here at Amazon, it seemed there were very few holsters to choose from.  This one seemed to have a lot of positive reviews, and looked close to what I liked from my 3Gs holster, so I gave it a try.

It has been doing the job very well so far, and someone else might be totally happy with this holster, however there are a few aspects that detracted from my overall experience.
1. The holster is bulkier than it needs to be, which makes it stick out and get hung up on things.
2. The two bottom corners that hold the phone seem to protrude an awful lot, and get caught on things.  (my old holster had a continuous piece across the bottom, which seemed to get tangled in things less, and felt like less of a protrusion.
3. The clip at the top sticks out past the phone a good deal, and always has me worried that it will catch on something and release the phone allowing it to drop.  The spring tension in the clip isn't too strong, which also makes me a little nervous that it is going to drop my phone.

They may be smallies to other folks, but to me, I really appreciate having a phone without a cover, so having a holster is critical.  For me to give 5 stars, the holster must not be a burden, and give me peace of mind that the phone is not going to take a tumble.

UPDATE:  So far, the holster has worked fine a a year and a half.  The iPhone has never fallen out, and stays securely on my belt.  Today, one of the hinges for the belt clip broke.  The item still works, but is less secure on my belt, and I fear the extra stress may make the other side of the hinge break soon.

After poking around a bit, I decided to stick with the Samsung brand and picked this guy up.  My phone does make it from morning-to-night now on a single charge.  Even with heavy use!  I find myself browsing the internet, using Google Talk or just texting/emailing frequently throughout any given day (in fact, my job sometimes requires frequent emails.)

Before: I take the phone off the charger around 8AM and I come home by 7PM with about 25% charge (or less, on a few occasions,) even if I used the car charger to-and-from work, which is a 25 minute drive each way!

Given, I went to this from an iPhone, but it shouldn't be so different.

To say this phone's battery life is abysmal is an understatement. Don't even think about trying to use a live background or it will be dead within a few hours. One of the first nights I had this phone it was 80-85% charged, I turned on the live background and by morning the phone was nearly completely dead. Just recently I noticed that I couldn't charge the phone anymore on any charger. Just wouldn't recognize it. I had to hard reboot the phone to get it to charge at all. I've only had it for a couple months, but having to physically remove the battery to get it to unfreeze has become fairly common.

It frequently locks up when trying to do anything, even just unlocking the phone to use it sometimes takes 15-20 seconds for it to respond. Apps (especially Facebook) frequently crash or freeze, and it takes forever to update the news feed (sometimes it doesn't update at all.) When I have to reboot my phone just to see Facebook updates, something is wrong. Data in general is extremely slow on this phone. Also to use wifi, even at home, I have to go into the settings and select which network I want to connect to every time I unlock the phone. Absolutely ridiculous.

I actually had to keep my old iPhone around because I can basically only use this LG as a phone and navigation. Navigation is one thing I'm impressed with, but it too frequently locks up and won't update where I am.

It's always giving me ""memory low"" warnings, even without downloading new apps. There's no way to automatically save to the SD card, so the crappy internal memory is constantly getting filled up, forcing me to manually close apps and delete old data and text messages.

I'm honestly flabbergasted that so many people like this phone, I swear they're all coming from a 15 year old Nokia. This thing should not qualify as a smartphone.

First of all, there's a lot of reviews out there, some are dead on and others are plainly going to extremes (bad reviews).

I'll to try to keep mine closer to facts.

Shipping and hardware. I've got mine in no time and excellent conditions. The phone is awesome looking and it's built with the excellence of Nokia hardware. The battery will last 3 to 4 days on a modest usage, and 1 and half days when using lots of apps and data transactions. 0 complaints in this area.

Call and SMS. Great call quality, great loudspeaker quality and the SMS app or ""Conversatios"" as it's called are great. So, purely on the cell phone aspect, this is truly one of the best (compared to my wife's iPhone 4, 0 dropped calls or bad calls).

Camera and Video Recorder. This is THE strong point of this phone. Great pictures and the video is gorgeous (720 HD). Has a couple of editing tools (for both images and video), but, you know, nothing you didn't have already on your PC. Score a solid 10 on this.

GPS. I had an XpressMusic 5800 before this, and this was one of my favorite qualities (one of very few). In this phone the navigation (using ONLY gps) is faster and overall, it's awesome. Love the fact that data connection is totally optional and the tools and maps are being updated often. So another big 10 on this aspect.

Radio & FM Transmitter. Not that they are directly related, but the two worked great. No problems at all on the radio side (I use it on a daily basis). On the FM Transmitter I did have problems of connection at first, but all it took was to change the default frequency (in my case from 90.0 to 90.5) and that was it, worked great! Another 10!

Video viewer. I love the fact that I can see (in excellent quality) movies here and, if needed, transmit them (via HDMI) to a TV. The formats, well, I copied an M4V file (ripped one of my DVD's using HandBreak) to the phone and ended up converting it, automatically, to WMV, so it took like an hour to do this, but maybe there are easier ways :P. Anyways, another 10.

Apps. The truth is that although there are a lot of applications (some good, some not so much), it doesn't compare (and it probably will never) to either the store of Apple or Android. But it does have most basic stuff. Lets call this a not to solid 7.

O.S. Well, now we come to the REAL aspect in which this phone falls way back. So, for starters this is way faster and responsive than the XpressMusic (if any users are thinking on upgrading), but to be honest, the real valid comparison should be to, for example, a Nexus One (Android) or iPhone 4. I mention this two because I have tried both. So, I'm just gonna say that the OS is like half the speed of the Nexus One and a third of the stability of the iPhone 4 :S
But let's not compare, shall we, or we'll go through a dark and very popular path. Lets just say that with the first software update (PR1.1) most instabilities and errors have been fixed. The phone it's 80% of the time pretty ""fluid"" while navigating through the interface and using most apps. Still has some ""hanging"" problems (reset not needed, only needs some seconds people :P), but not as bad as the beginning (I would say that at first it was only fluid 60% of the time). I'm hoping that further updates will keep refining the overall OS.

And, FYI, although Nokia has made a partnership with Microsoft, they have said (and clarify it in BIG BOLD letters), they will continue to maintain the Symbian's phones, so I'm pretty sure updates will still come (at least a couple more). Oh yeah, for anyone who cares, this whole OS thing, well I give it a 7 (with update considered).

So anyways, just to sum up my review, this phone (as you can see from the ""scores"") is a very interesting smart phone with great features and although in the OS department it falls way short to some of its main competition, it still has great strong advantages.
Lets say that if you mainly use the calendar, email (sync both to your outlook and/or Gmail!), camera, video recorder, video viewer, PURE GPS navigating, calling/SMS (duh!) and minor to mild usage of apps, this phone is a great option.
If you mainly want it to have great (or the best) apps and because of it need the phone to run flawlessly, spend and extra 150 to 200 dollars and buy an Nexus One, HTC Desire or an iPhone 4.

In my case, I'm in the first group, so, I'm pretty happy the phone.

Hope it helps.","Good phone, but...",1298505600,3.0,,

It always sucked to browse a little, text and check emails to lose 15 to 20 percent of power. When you do the math, the maxx has a 3400 ah battery. The razr has 1700 built in. When you add the back up battery, you have 4100ah. Need I say that is more than the maxx?

Don't hesitate. This is a solid buy and a must have for any Droid Razr owner. I am very happy.

It makes my phone go all day from 7am to 10pm and i get home with 50% battery lifw if I use it just to charge. Hint: If you wait for your phone to go down 20% or so and turn it on, it will charge the phone and then shut off and you repeat a few times before it dies. Because it charges and runs the phone at the same time, this kills the battery quicker. Turn it on within 5 nimutes (3 to 5% usage on the phone and it will work as the primary power source until it is empty and then will let the phone battery handle it. In 7 hours, I still have 100% phone battery and 3 led's of 5 on this battery. It helps to turn off 4g. Verizon's 3g will do the trick for most everything.

Thankfully I had insurance so I was given a brand new replacement. T-Mobile decided to give me the new color for the galaxy s2 they started carrying (Steel Gray) and when I opened the box I instantly fell in love with it. I decided to take care of this one and started doing some research for a good screen protector. After reading many reviews and watching videos on youtube, I decided that this product was the one. Now I will be setting up this review into two categories so you can decide if its the right one for you.

The Good
- Comes very well packaged with a lot of materials that is needed to set the protector up.
- Provides very detailed step by step instruction as to how to install the protector.
- Also provides a link to an instructional video so you can watch step by step if the instructions aren't clear enough for you.
- The screen protector itself is self healing, which ensures you a long service.
- Once the protector is installed, it is barely visible.
- It is fool proof. Since it is applied using a wet applicator, it lets you keep trying even if you mess up.
- Fits perfectly to the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy SII (U.S. Version)
- Very inexpensive compared to big retail brands such as Zagg invisishield.
- Takes less than 5 minutes to install.

The Bad
- The installation process isn't similar to the generic screen protectors and might be a little tough on someone who has had no experience with screen protectors before.
- You can only adjust the screen protector with the liquid solution provided.
- Only provides one screen protector.
- The card provided to wipe out bumps and liquid from under the screen protector is now made of rubber, and it leaves color marks and it deteriorates leaving little debris on the screen protector if you put too much pressure.

Overall it is an amazing product for the price your paying and I honestly do believe this is one of the best screen protectors for this phone. Instead of going to an electronic store and spending 30 bucks, save some money and purchase this online.",Great,1353888000,13.0,,

If your  not familiar with Nokia phones and your considering a smart phone, you should check out Nokia's app store at[...] and browse some of the apps.

Everything on the phone works as it should. The 650Mhz proccessor is fast enough to power all the funtions of the phone. I have dowloaded a 10MB file in 19 seconds via a Wi-fi connection and a 7MB file in 18 seconds. I don't have a data plan with my carrier (At&T) because I have Wi-fi at home and at work, sinse these are the two places I spend most of my time I really don't need it.

The turn by turn GPS (Drive & Walk) works very well.

If I had to pick one thing to change it would be the overall size. But even this is being petty. The phone fits in my hands well and the onscreen keys are really easy to use and unlike the iphones, I rarely if never double hit a key unintentionally. I really like the vibration created when you touch an icon or key. Its a very slight vibration but it tricks your brain into thinking you actually pressed a real button.

I got it for myself, but gave it away to my nephew as a graduation present because he liked it so much.  At the current price point, only a LG Thrive/Optimus/Phoenix is comparable and the Samsung is much higher quality.

In the U.S. it will only work at EDGE speeds, so this is not a U.S. 3G phone.

In terms of responsiveness, the phone is reasonably fast, with no unpleasant lag or unresponsiveness.  The music player works great, and the phone itself is good as a cell phone.

Because this phone is unlocked, it works on many GSM-based carriers (AT&T and T-mobile), including overseas GSM carriers.  My nephew was able to use it in Panama and phone/text me from it.  It will not work with CDMA carriers (Sprint and Verizon, for example).

The Android 2.1 operating system is sufficient for most purposes.  You will need a google account to download from the Google Market.

The phone will have menus in a foreign language, but it's not too hard to find the settings and switch the language to English.  This may take a bit of experimentation, and the faint of heart may be put off by this.

It looked good on paper.  Despite tweaking the antenna and studying the FAQ and the troubleshooting, it does not work for me.  I returned it today.

I live midway in a 62 story high rise in the center of a major city.  On my terrace I get 4 bars and sometimes five on my cell phone (street level I get five bars when outside my building).  Indoors it depends on where I am.  When I am near the windows I get four bars.  Deep inside the bars fall to one (like in my office).  I thought this would be the ideal product to give me better coverage when deep inside.  I was disappointed.

I have large (4' x 8') floor to ceiling windows and was able to set the antenna about 20"" from the metal mullions and about 16"" above the floor (my cell phone at this location showed four bars).  The interior base antennna was 6 and 1/2 feet above the floor (about 5 feet above the antenna) and about 28 feet away.  The bars on the phone even when I was 'line of sight' with no obstructions was three.  I get more bars near the window (four).

I was very disappointed in the performance and despite tweaking (moving the antenna around the window and making sure it hung vertically) the bars on the cell phone inside my apartment were no more than three bars (line of sight).  This was in the great room where the base was located. In that room when I was by the window I had four bars.  The recommended lateral and vertical seperation of the antenna and the base was exceeded by a considerable amount, based on the manufacturer's recommendations.

The killer:  bedroom one and two - each on the other side of a wall - the signal was only two bars and the connection static was disruptive when talking on the phone (esp. in my bedroom).  As the crow flies when the two bars were there I was 27-28 feet from the base and the only thing seperating me from the base was drywall and studs.  When I went right up to the window I was able to get three bars on my phone in each bedroom.

For whatever reason, this product did not work for me.",I was very disappointed,1322352000,2.0,,

I work in a steelmill and my phone is ALWAYS in my pocket so I need a rugged case. I was going to purchase the 4s version of the otterbox but I had grown to not like how ""over bulky"" the defender cases are. This case is the absolute BEST solution for protection AND comfort. The charging port is large enough for every plug I have from the OEM apple ones to the various aftermarket ones I have for car/home/ use. I do not use a docking station but I'd assume the iphone wouldn't work with the case on.
PRO
*The case feels comfortable in my hand and the rubber parts keep it steady when your holding it.
*The cutout for the rear camera is large and trimmed in black(white/black case) so there is NO glare in photo's.
*The volume buttons stick out slightly farther then the trim for easy locating by feel, but they are not too easy to press so no accidental volume changes.
*Case fits my white 4s(att) absolutely perfect! Snug and solid.
*The trim around the front of the case ""just fits"" over the edges of a screen protector. With my 'normal' use and in 2 days the case has NOT caused the screen protector to come off(MANY cases I've tried do)
*Looks absolutely awesome with a white 4s

Con
*The opening for the mute switch is just the right size BUT with the thickness of the case it's really deep. My bad habit of biting my nails makes me NOT able to use the mute switch without using something to ""pry"" it with like a car key or something. If you have ""normal"" nails or thinner fingers(like most women have) you won't have an issue. ""Working man's hands""...not so much.

Also: This is ONLY the case in retail packaging. There is NO included screen protector like a lot of other cases have. But honestly these screen protector are a dime a dozen on Amazon so who cares.

I'm a teenage boy, and i'm not very rough with my phones; but I like having my phone protected. I've slowly shed the need for a super-obnoxious case like the otterbox, and have gone down the scale of obnoxious cases to more minimal cases. I've had the defender, commuter, the knock off commuter from amazon, the speck candy shell, the original pixel skin, cheap tpu cases, the pop case, and the bumper; and I have to say hands down this one is my favorite out of all the cases i've ever owned for this product and will be using this one until my iphone decides to die (which i hope it never will)

First off, it's the perfect balance between slim and protection. The tpu cases I've used had the perfect amount of slim, but never felt very durable if I ever dropped them (to this day I never dropped my iphone in the cheap amazon TPU's and god knows what wouldve happened). Then the other cases I described had the perfect amount of protection, especially the candy shell which i've used now for 4 months but recently the hard part on the top is becoming detached from the rubber lining because the phone went through a rough drop =( I decided to go on amazon and get a new candyshell, but then I came across the pixelskin HD which caught my eye because i'm a complete fan of blue and it just popped out at me. So without any hesitation, i just ordered it and if dissapointed i'd just return it no problem. I received it today and realized it's a TPU matte case that snaps right on, and it has a nice lip around the screen for protection, and it's just the case i've always been looking for. Not too bulky, but not to slim and fragile. Not super protected and beefed up, but has the right amount of protection and feel to it that I need as a kid on the go all of the time. Today I already dropped my phone on concrete with the case, and the case stood up perfect and it absorbed the impact perfectly and my iphone is still like brand new. The thing I like most is that it's a hard/soft case so it slides in and out of pockets easy, doesnt attract lint, and it has better impact absorbing then those annoying silicone skins.

The best thing about these is that when they are folded, they are turned off. No battery drain, no accidental calls when the button is depressed in your pocket. If it is open and you press the button, it will immediately answer the call. If it is folded (off) you must wait a few seconds (2-3) for it to ""boot up""

The range of the H-720 is not as good as its predecessor (only about 20 ft and/or 1 wall), but the overall design is much better (recessed main button; more solid boom; better volume control buttons; more comfortable fit; not so bright bluetooth light - the old light was bright enough to signal aircraft!)

If you are frustrated by making accidental calls when carrying your BT headset, there is no other quality headset out there that offers this unique feature. It may not offer the same quality as Plantronics, but if you've ever made an accidental 45 minute voicemail or call in the middle of the night, this device is a must have.

Coupled with the fact that I have a 15 month old son and a little clumsy, well I DEFINITELY wanted to have my Iphone super duper protected. I ordered from Amazon and had the free shipping. Amazon is great! I got it relatively fast.

Box & Packaging: First glance, it looks somewhat cheap but of course the most important thing is the product itself right?

Product: I got the Red and Black version. There is the Hard Case and the Red Silicone that goes around it. The Hard Case is black plastic. It felt tough to me. There are holes for all the buttons (i.e. the charging hole, volume, Silent mode, earphone, camera etc.) The back of the Hard Case also had a circular hole to display the Apple Logo which is cool. The front of the Hard Case has a glass or plastic glass for the touch screen. The back ofof the hardcase has some sort of felt material all around the Circle glass opening (the one to show the Apple Logo) and that is to protect the back of the iphone/so it wouldn't have any scratches. Cool! So far, I have had NO problems in operating the touch screen. It is great!!! I prefer this than those screen protectors. No worries about bubbles and all that. The Red Silicone is a semi dull red. It is ""red red"" but I wouldn't say it was a super duper bright red like in the picture. I still like it though.  The back of the Red Silicone has super tiny diamond shape all over and the Otterbox logo on the bottom. The Red Silicone also has the holes to fit over the Black Case and be able to access the buttons and little flaps over all the openings so if it is not in use, you can cover them to avoid dust. The only thing I've noticed so far is that the Charger Flap (the bottom of the phone) you have to really press it to keep it locked/close it just right to lock it into place. No biggie for me as I use the phone a lot so I almost always open it to plug the charger. I felt the other flaps I had no trouble locking/pushing them into place. It also comes with a holster thing if you want it to hang on your pants or something. It can also serve as a stand.

Installation: It was fairly easy. Opening and Closing them wasn't too hard. There are three little tabs that you kinda push/unclip to open it and then you press the case together to lock it into place. My only advice is you make sure no dust/smudgies get into the glass. Unfortunately for me, my 15 month old son saw me and somehow he got a little drool into the plastic glass thing so it was a semi pain trying to remove those smudges from the inside plastic glass screen. As mentioned above, there is a felt material on the back of the hard case so be careful to not have any lint or yuckies on it because it is hard to clean the felt material. Putting and removing the silicone on the hard case was easy. It was easy to remove it/stretchy and you just press the red silicone all over to lock it into place.

My Three Day Use: Yes, so far I am very happy with it. It just feels solid and well protected. I brought it with me to Ihop and played my sons learning videos so he wouldn't get fussy/screaming while we were eating. I used the holster/stand and it was very cool! It didn't topple over or anything. And then my son tried to reach for the Iphone and put smudges on the screen, thank goodness for the glass screen protector! Of course, you can see some fingerprint oiliness/smudges but that also happeneed when i used the iphone screen itself. So I just wipe/clean it with those lcd cloths. I don't really use the belt holster. It's nice but I have this fear or someone snatching it from my pocket. Plus it is a little big when you put them all together so I just put the phone in my jacket pocket. I only use the belt holster case as a stand. I may use it as a holster but only inside and when I'm wearing jacket to cover it. The camera pics quality seem to be fine even though there is a another plastic glass to protect it. I haven't done a side by side comparison yet if there is a degradation in quality with and without the case.

OVERALL: Extremely happy with my purchase. I bought it with my number one reason for protecting it from damages and scratches and it definitely feels like it will be protected. It does make your Iphone larger and bulkier so if you don't want that, then don't get it. But if you want toughness and protection without having to buy different things (i.e. separate case, separate screen protector) then get this. It looks great too in my honest opinion! I'm SOOOO tempted to get the other colors especially the blue LOL

UPDATE: 10/25/11 Remember, I have a toddler son that loves to play with my iphone and drop and sometimes step on it or smack it with his hand. So far the Iphone 4 is still brand spanking new, no cracks, breaks etc. BUT the silicone thing itself is kinda of stretched out and damaged. I got the black/red version. The stretchy thing sometimes goes out of place so I have to press it back in so I'm not too happy about that. Also, I'm not sure if the numerous falls caused my Iphone camera focus to go out of place (basically it wasn't focusing just going in and out) so I sent my iphone back for repair. Overall, Id have to take a few stars off because the red silicone thing doesn't really fit well anymore into the hard case and I always have to press it back in. And the glass or plastic glass gets smudgy right away so its kind of annoying to clean. I think I'll have to give it a 3 stars now. My Iphone 4 does seem protected in that there was no cracks and damages but it doesn't look that nice anymore and as mentioned, the silicone stretchy thing is way stretched and goes out of place. I've decided to order a gumdrop and see how that goes as I ordered one for my Ipad 2 and it looks and feels REALLY sturdy and doesn't seem like it would go out of place.",Makes Iphone bulky but definitely is well protected!!!,1290470400,31.0,,

I don't think this is exactly what she had in mind (as I'm not sure what she was thinking, because what case would be 100% water proof, yet still allow for head phone jack to be used while running?), but I think it would work for the most part.  The case itself is made of a durable thick plastic that is molded together into one seam running around on three sides.  There is no easy access to your power or volume buttons, though if you push really hard, you can utilize them. It's a little cumbersome, but I don't think this was intended to be a case where you are fully utilizing your phone, rather it's more to keep it safe from water damage while you're out extreme sporting.

If using a smaller case, or no case at all, you'll have no problems accessing the screen through the plastic.  Additionally, there is a window on the back for what I assume is to allow you to use your camera while it's in the case.  The top appears to seal very well, though the two ""knobs"" or ""dials"" that you turn to open are REALLY hard (at least harder than I'd expect with something like this).  There are arrows and letters on the top  'C ->' 'O <-' on the left side and 'O->' 'C <-' on the right side, indicating which way to turn the knob/dials to open and close the case.  Turn both dials outwards and the top opens, slide your phone in (sans case if you want an easy fit), and then turn both dials inwards and the top seals shut tight.  I didn't submerge my phone inside this case, as I wasn't sure exactly how ""water proof"" it was, though I did end up folding up a paper towel and putting it inside the case, then fully submerging it under water for 60 seconds.  The paper towel was dry upon opening the case, however, a few drops did remain around the top, which did drip inside the case.  If you take care to dry the case thoroughly before opening it, I believe the inside would remain 100% dry.  Overall, I don't think this is a bad case if you're looking for the water proof attributes, but this isn't something I'd recommend for biking/running, as you'll more than likely want to use your head phones, and there is no easy way to use the headphones with this case, unless you leave the top open, thus eliminating the water proofing abilities.","Not exactly what I thought it was going to be, but it works as advertised.",1355702400,20.0,,

I can't bring myself to completely be unconcerned about getting the iPad immersed- bcz it's such an expensive item for me- but I have to say this case has never given me ANY reason to think the iPad is in danger. I don't know how it would survive being UNDERwater for a few days- but I can definitely vouch for the occasional deep plunge and lots of splashes.

Although Amazon LLC sells the item, it's over one-third more than other sellers. Before buying, I contacted Amazon customer service and they said I would get a full, no questions asked refund if the phone did not work with my SIM card if I used either Amazon or an Amazon Fulfillment seller. So I went for such a seller, less than Amazon LLC but not the rock-bottom cheapest.

What I received appeared to be in brand new condition: the box was sealed, and so were all the bags inside. The charger has a US plug but can be used overseas. The battery appeared to be new too, and after being charged under three hours held it for over 36 hours.  The phone was unlocked, but T-Mobile branded. It worked with both my T-Mobile SIM and a UK (English) pay-as-you-go SIM.

I wanted a quad band, unlocked GSM cell phone for overseas travel.  This phone fits the bill, and the aesthetics are nice.  Folded, the phone is quite pocketable.  Open, the size is easy enough to manage.  Both the exterior and huge interior screens are color.  The lighted keypad looks like ""Tron"" in its use of a blue florescent design.

The owner's manual is quite skimpy and cheaply printed as other reviewers suggest. But I was able to download the full manual as a PDF from Motorola's web site.  The supplied manual is small enough to keep in a wallet while travelling, though.

I didn't try sending an MMS, but received one or two of SMS advertisements, so text messaging works.  If you want a phone for overseas travel that will work in almost any country with a local SIM card, consider this one.  As long as you buy from Amazon LLC or use a seller with Amazon Fulfillment, you a) probably will not have any problems and b) will at least get a no questions asked refund with the seller paying return shipping if what you receive does not work as described.",No Surprises With Amazon Fulfillment,1322006400,3.0,,

This is not because there is something wrong with the product, but putting a screen protector is quite difficult to achieve a perfect result.  Lint and dust are always a problem.

I first cleaned the iPhone screen with an optical spray applied on a piece of cloth, and then gave several gusts of air from a compressed gas duster.  I was able to align the protector almost perfectly but I got several bubbles.  I repeated the process and almost got it the next time.  On the third attempt, I was satisfied after pushing the bubbles to the side.  Pushing the bubbles with the cardboard only works if there is no speck of dust or lint under the screen.

The matte screen really helps with the glare; it is also less susceptible to fingerprints.  When my kids play with grease on their hands, I just wipe it off and cleans easily.

What you get:
3 matte/anti-glare screen protectors, small cloth, and a small piece of cardboard to push the bubbles out. Instruction is at the back.

I have stopped using this product, the plastic front has made such a large opening on the sides that I do not feel comfortable wearing this.  I have tried some Belkin armbands that have worked perfectly and have not separated.  I recommend spending a little more and getting Belkin or a better brand.  This one just did not stand up to use.  --I have posted pictures of how it buckled out.

I have an iPhone 4 and got this to be able to use the Nike+ Running app when exercising.  I saw this and for around $10, thought it might be ok.  I got it and it looked nice, the phone fits in it nicely and I could plug in the headphone through the hole and control the screen through the plastic.  However, when I got ready to go for a walk, I tried putting it around the top of my arm, and it was very tight and uncomfortable, and the plastic was seeming to pop out of the side of the case.  I took it off the top of my arm, and wrapped it around the lower part of my arm (under the elbow) and that felt a bit more comfortable, but the plastic was still popping out (you can touch the phone between the plastic and siding of the front case), and the plastic is buckling on some parts of the phone (I posted a photo to the item image).  For $10, I expected better, and am a tad bit disappointed.  However, it does serve its purpose.  I still use it and the phone stays in the case (bottom and top are holding phone and plastic nicely).  I sometimes have to press the plastic down to use the phone in the center (luckily the Nike+ app has the functions at the bottom and top, so it is not a large problem).  The cloth does cause your arm to sweat, but I have not had any rashes or any other problems under the band, so apparently the skin can breathe, and although the band itself will be soaked in sweat the phone is dry and the fabric does not allow the phone to get wet.

On this battery, I would get better battery life but average about 11 hours on the same usage patterns. While admittedly, that's better, it's not enough. With the advertised mAh rating, the battery should last twice as long, not 22% longer. The increased bulk would be worth twice the battery life but not the lower achieved battery life.

Aside from the limited increase in battery life, the top tabs on the battery door cover also broke. This happened after replacing the battery approximately three times. The cover still stays on but I question the quality. It does look good enough though.

One interesting note is that nowhere on the battery does it state the capacity. Most batteries will state its mAh rating but not this one.

Screen is amazing
Perfect size (In all honesty it is not that big, the thinness of the phone helps)
You will find yourself using your desktop/laptop for casual browsing far far less especially when using Opera browser on the Note.

The 8mp camera takes very good stills. Flash also does a good job at giving light to your subject.

I also have the Incipio NGP case which is slim but doesn't fit as snugly on the sides as I'd like.  The back of it also covers the Apple logo.  I also have the Elago slim fit, which is excellent - very form fitting, but the area around the screen is flush (it doesn't raise up at all) and so if it lands face down from a drop, I'm done.  And then I found this case...

This is an EXCELLENT bumper case (A ""bumper"" case, for those who don't know, is like a frame.  It wraps around the perimeter of the phone only. Nothing covers the front or back).  Here's the deal with this case:

1. Fits my Verizon iphone 4 perfectly.  It's nice and snug all around.

2. Very stylish.  The white really looks better than I anticipated.  Anytime I take my phone out to answer a text or whatever, people ask about it.

3. Maintains the aesthetics of the phone since it's very thin and doesn't cover the front or back.

4. Very nice grip/feel and is not a lint collector if you keep it in your pocket.

5. Will offer - in my opinion - protection against basic waist-high type drops.  The corners and sides are covered and the front and back screens have the raised rubber bumper which should provent any shattering.  I doubt it will help against a major drop.  NOT the case for you if you're rough with your phone or are prone to dropping it.

6. Fast shipping and extremely low price.  I'm always nervous with these ""side dealers"" on Amazon, but I'm happy with the product so far.

7. One caveat: Again, this is a case for those looking for style/aesthetics and are careful with their phone.  The metal covers on the case for the power and volume buttons seem a little delicate (like they can rip off if you're rough with it) so keep that in mind. For this price point, I would be happy even if I only got 6 months out of it, but I'm sure it will last longer if you're a good phone person.

-It works, so if you need a case that will give you a longer iphone battery life then try this case.
-It does add some weight to the phone but not too much, you may feel awkward lugging around you iPhone but the extra battery life is worth it.
-There's no fancy design or glossy finish which is great because you rarely see any fingerprints of any sort.
-Charges pretty quickly.
-No over heating problems

Cons:
-The case has some problems with certain screen protectors which can be solved by not using the top half but then the iPhone has less protection.
-The supposed sync featured does not work at least not for me running the latest iTunes 10.4, I get an error message with missing data shown in yellow.
-The led lights are a great way to notify when the case is charged but it is a pain at night since the lights are bright that it could disturb your sleep (if the phone is next to you which most likely is).
-You do get extra battery life but you never get a full charge. If you deplete your iPhone's battery, do not expect the case to fully charge your phone to 100%, you will probably get around 75% or a lil more which is not a big deal but I thought it would be good to know.
-Price, I feel that mophie may be overcharging since there are other similar slimmer models from competitors such as QVG and phonesuit.

3.0,True,2011-10-30,A275EOYAIDKYAU,B004L62KL6,,Jimh615,"I lost my Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset by Plantronics and decided to replace it with the much acclaimed Plantronics 38885-01 Voyager PRO UC B230 (Standard).

Before the pro I had a Motorola 850 which you could open or close the tiny microphone boom and that would disconnect the Bluetooth from the phone.  Convenient!! The basic Voyager PRO would not do that; you had to push on a button for a couple seconds and turn it off or you could disconnect it using an icon on the phone, otherwise it would stay connected to your phone.  This upgraded version sounded like the answer.  After all, it knows when it's on your ear and when it's not........as it turns out, not exactly.

First the good:

  1  The sound quality is very very good; probably the best there is in a Bluetooth  phone headset.
  2  Although rather large, it is very comfortable.
  3  The battery life is all day using it a lot (a lot = several 1 hour conversations per day).
  4  The included case is a very nice holster with a sturdy clip for sliding the case on your belt, in your purse, in a camera bag.  If you place the case on the outside of a bag, it may fall off; it's NOT secure. (The fate of my basic Voyager PRO)
  5  The PRO UC's ability to suppress extraneous noise is EXCELLENT !!!!  From water running in your sink, an espresso maker, an espresso bean grinder, the obnoxious sound of the beeper telling you you left the keys in your car....all dampened well.  My gauge for this test?  My fiancee who acts like she has just suffered permanent hearing damage if I tried to do any of the above before.  Now  says the sounds are barely audible and hardly annoying.  YES !!!!!)

The not so good:

  1  The enterprise software designed to allow you to modify factory settings installs easily but after 1 hour of trying I cannot get it to work.  Although i'm fairly computer savvy, required for my job, even if I weren't you should not have to have a computer science degree to work it. (VISTA 64 bit)
  2  The range of the unit from my HTC Incredible is less in my 1200 sq ft house than my basic Voyager Pro was.  But, still good.
  3  The reason I bought it was: Because the unit knew when it was on my ear and when it wasn't.  Well, that turns out not to be completely true.
 .... If you end a conversation, hang up and then take the PRO UC ear piece off your ear and place it in your purse/pocket/table, it doesn't understand that.  It will remain connected.  If you try to call using the phone or someone calls in, you will not be able to hear them on the phone because the PRO UC remains connected.
 .... However, if you remove the Bluetooth from your ear DURING the conversation, the PRO UC DOES understand that and WILL disconnect.  If you continue to talk on the phone and then place the PRO UC back on your ear it WILL reconnect.  Again, the auto connect and disconnect only works if you are talking on the phone.  If you are not talking on the phone, there is NO ongoing call, this auto feature of knowing whether it is on your ear or not, does NOT work for me.  And I bought it for that feature.

Please look at the picture I have submitted as to what is in the box.  No place in the Amazon/Plantronics specs., does it mention the inclusion of a case.  The case does come with it; don't by the case unless you want two.  As mentioned above, the case is an excellent design and well built.

I give the PRO UC three stars, because of it's failure to understand whether it is on my ear or not when I am not connected.  This feature was the reason I bought it.
If you don't care about this feature.....it's a 5+ star in my opinion.  Then why not just buy the Basic Voyager PRO?  Because it doesn't have the fantastic noise suppression the PRO UC does.

UPDATE:  16 Feb 2012:  I have really wanted to love this headset...for all its attributes, clear sound etc.  But a nagging problem has been its lack of true understanding whether it is on my ear or not.  At times shifting back and forth between audio through the headset and an uncommanded transfer back to the phone while I'm talking or the other person is.  I have dealt with this problem on and off from the beginning.  Tonight, however, it came to a head.  I'm in traffic, on my bluetooth, talking to my boss.  The bluetooth starts shifting or call between the phone and the bluetooth.  My boss gets frustrated.....fearing a wreck I politely try to explain briefly my problem.

I am in field where I get a lot of calls and it is imperative that I have a good connection and can hear my clients clearly.  I decided to buy several different model bluetooth sets and compare them side by side since they all have at least a 30 day return policy.  First I bought a motorola, waste of money, disconnected and unpaired constantly.  Second I moved up to the jawbone Icon.  fair volume, super uncomfortable and without the hook that was unbendable and caused blisters, it would fall out of your ear just by chewing.. I did like the features, especially caller ID and voice dial.  But after several drops out of my ear the sound quality was gone and I returned that one too.  Next I tried the Plantonics Voyager HD (top of the line)  and was NOT impressed.  The volume was insufficent and in a noisy enviornment, even at full volume (30) it was difficult to hear.  I also didn't like the fact that you had to pay extra for voice control service...and although they give you a free 1 year subscription to their vocalyst program, after one year you have to pay for an ongoing subscription, which is pure greed and unacceptable, the same service is totally free on the  jawbone Icon and Jabra Supreme, ...and lastly, the Voyager  did not even support caller ID, and for such a pricey bluetooth, that was the clincher for me.  Returned that one too.  Decided on the Jabra Supreme. I was nervous about it due to the reviews that it was bulky and wouldnt stay in the ear, like the Jawbone Icon.  But I went ahead and took a chance.  Turns out this is far and away the best of them all.  With the extra earpad that comes with it hooks inside your ear and combined with the soft bendable hook it is totally secure and I felt it was as secure as the Plantronics voyager.  The volume is superb.  In fact, at half way up its louder than the plantronics at full blast.  The sound quality is the best by  light years. (compares to a corded phone)  When I would voice text with the Voyager, I had to constantly repeat myself to get it right, with the Supreme....perfect voice texting it hears you clearly.  All the voice commands work perfectly.  The only complaint is the unit is big and thus not too stylish, but it more than makes up for it in incredible performance.

I've had probably 10 different cases for my iPhone 4. I had one case for my 2G, 3G and 3Gs, but the boxy form factor of the iPhone 4 has made finding a suitable case somewhat troublesome as they all tend to exaggerate the squareness and create a brick in my pocket.

A Brief Introduction to My Experience with Rokform Products:
A few months ago, I bought the original Rokform Aluminum case (the one you put together with tiny screws). I absolutely loved it, except for one large flaw. It severely impeded my reception. I live in a rural area and sometimes only have 2-3 bars. With the aluminum case on there, I would drop calls several times a day and my signal was extremely weak. In my house where I have a very strong WiFi signal as well as a 3G MicroCell Tower, the load times were horrible, no matter which one I used (3G or WiFi).

Fortunately, I was able to part with my Aluminum Rokform case at only a slight loss via the great online auction site. When I saw the new aluminum cases with the poly-carbonate bottom half, I got excited and was thinking that may have solved the antenna issues. Reluctant to drop another $80 on an aluminum case, I waited and saw the Rokbed V3. Bingo! A poly-carbonate case with the style, durability and Made-In-USA approach that I appreciate from Rokform.

My Review of the Rokbed V3:
I received the RBV3 today (thanks Amazon Prime!). It snapped on the phone easily and looks great. It's not super bulky and fits in my (slim) jeans pocket nicely. My co-worker liked it enough that she ordered a pink one. This case is great. I've got 4 bars of reception here at my office with full Wi-Fi signal. With the Aluminum, I'd have one or two bars and 2 bars of Wi-Fi signal. This is good. The case fits snugly and works well with a screen protector on. No bubbling on the edges or interference at all. All of the buttons and ports are readily accessible and my Bose In-Ears work wonderfully with the generous spacing around the headphone port. I also appreciate the small indentation at the top near the sleep/power button as it makes getting to it just slightly easier with the pad of my finger (as opposed to the tip). The same is true for the volume rockers. I can easily adjust the volume using the pad of my finger or thumb while talking without having to alter my grip on the phone. All good things, yes?

While I love this case and I did point out some of my favorite attributes, there are a couple of issues with it that make it slightly less than perfect and cost Rokform a star on this one. Both of the issues I have are attributed to the Remote Mounting System (RMS). While I appreciate the system and I can see the plethora of add-ons that Rokform could run with, it's a bit unnecessary in my opinion. First, when I originally opened the package and got the phone in the case, I snapped the RMS onto the case. Bad idea. It took me quite some time to get it off. I ended up putting my phone under one foot and using both hands to twist the RMS off the back of the case. What this tells me is:

  A) There is no way the adhesive will stand up to the amount of torque required to remove the phone from the RMS, and
  B) If the super-strong RMS glue does break away due to said torque requirement, it's probably going to mar the dashboard of my car or at least leave an ugly glue stain.

I can't say for sure, but In my opinion, it shouldn't have been anywhere near that hard to remove the RMS from the back of the phone. Maybe it will loosen up, but I'm scared to put it back on there. Also, the RMS makes the case far more bulky than its previous aluminum counterpart. I wish Rokform made a version of this case that wasn't compatible with the RMS so that they could retain a much slimmer form factor while offering the styling and strength of the original Rokform offerings. Give me a Rokbed V4 without the ability to use the RMS and I'm sold 1000% Until then, I'll make do with the V3 as I think it is a superb case for the money.

On Rokform's website, they offer customization options that allow you to choose a top color, a bottom color and a rubber grippy-thing color. It's a $10 upgrade but one that might be worth it if you're looking for something extra-special for your phone. Also, if you're a fan of the RMS or you want to use it for something other than mounting, they make bottle openers and pocket clips that snap on and look pretty good.

All-in-all, this case impressed me and it'll stay on the phone for quite some time. I tend to get bored of cases fairly easily, but I think this one is exciting enough to keep me happy for a while. Thanks for reading. Feel free to post comments and questions and I'll respond as soon as I can.

********************
UPDATE 8/20/12
********************

Another member pointed out my ""prejudgement"" of the RMS feature of this case. I don't feel that I prejudged it, but perhaps judged it a little too soon. After my initial experience of trying to get the thing off the phone, I decided not to use it. I did go back and revisit the RMS and I attached it to the phone and removed it several times (probably 15-20, realistically). It loosened up some. I then attached the RMS receiver to my car dash and used it for a while. My iPhone is done (not because of this case) so I've switched to a different phone for the time being. I tried to remove the RMS receiver from my dash and it isn't going to happen anytime in the next 500 years or so. I don't know what adhesive they use, but you could build a bridge with it. That's a good thing because it requires a fairly significant amount of torque to get the phone on and off of the receiver.

Keep this in mind when you decide to stick your RMS receiver to the dashboard. Once it's there, it's there for good. You'll sell the car with it on there and so will the owner after you and the one after that. I'd be surprised if it ever came off. The car will probably go to the junk yard with that thing on there.

I love Rokform (still) and I love their customer service. They make innovative products with the end-user in mind. I'd buy from them in a heartbeat should I ever return to the iPlatform.

Setup:
  Upon purchasing and receiving the two Bluetooth Headset Adapters, I unboxed and charged them fully before testing.  I utilized the headsets that came with the units along with a control set of Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 vi In Ear Monitors.  I tested everything with my Apple iPhone 4s (Sprint) using iOS 5.0.1 and my Late 2011 MacBook Pro 15"" using OS 10.7.3 (Lion) for the tests.  Music comparisons used were Creed - Full Circle, Les Miserables - The Complete Symphonic Recording, Beethoven -The Immortal Collection and Nightwish - Angels Fall First.  I also utilized World of Warcraft for gaming on my laptop with these headsets as well playing for at least an hour while questing.

Unboxing:
  It goes without saying (but I'll say it here anyway), that most of these devices have a generic look and feel to them.  I mean how much can you do with a Bluetooth Headset adapter?  Even so, the packaging was actually very well done on both items.  No plastic to cut, no annoying twist ties to get anything out of the box.  Just the closed box and tape holding the flap closed.  Both the Sony and the Samsung had nice presentation of the device and both were very easy to remove and start using.  Both of these devices utilize MicroUSB chargers, so if you have other devices that use those connections, you only need to carry one type of charger to charge all of them.

Initial Thoughts:
  After the unboxing and initial charging of both items, I decided to take a closer look at each item.  Here are the lists of my thoughts on each item upon first inspection:

  Sony:  I really like the display on this device.  Very bright when needed and then shuts off.  No annoying flashing lights or any other attention getting gimmicks.  The buttons are nice to the touch and the Play/Pause button is slightly raised to make it easy to hit it.  I dislike the push and hold power on button as I prefer the sliding switch, but it wasn't like Sony used the button for anything else, so not a problem.  The clip on the MW600 seems a bit weak and seems a bit on the flimsy side, so that might be a problem.  BTW, this device has a radio and it does support RDS so it shows the song title, station ID, etc, but this feature is useless for me as I can't stand to listen to commercials so, I don't use the radio.  The size of the this device is very nice, but for clipping on my work shirts, this item is a bit thicker than I'd like.  The charging port on this device is open... I am not sure that I care to have the connectors open all of the time on this device while wearing this potentially everywhere.  I am sure this was done to avoid using dust covers, but I think this would have been a good idea.

  Samsung: I like the feel of this device in the hands... It feels sturdy without being heavy or bulky.  I dislike the single blue/purple/red LED on the front of the device to indicate battery, use, etc as I dislike attention getting flashing lights, but LED is useful as it does indicate the battery level.  I really like the power switch on this device.  It the perfect tension as to not turn on when you don't want it to and not too stiff as to require too much force to turn it on.  I have the Bose Bluetooth headset that I often turn on by accident when putting away, so this switch is a nice change from that headset.  Also the Play/Pause button is indented slightly from the other buttons making it easy to find as well.  Personally, I think I like the button better on the Sony as my fingers naturally find the extended button easier than the indented one... But I supposed engineers for Samsung were worried someone might accidentally press it if anything stuck out.  Only time will tell on that.  This device is the larger of the two being roughly twice the width of the Sony device, but it's half as thick.  I think this will be better for my work shirts as I can hide most of this device in the shirt.  The clip is very nicely done on this device and the charging port has a dust cover.

Initial Usage:
  After turning the devices on and pairing with my phone and computer, here are my thoughts on their usage before I take them out with me on the road.  BTW, pairing on each of these devices was very simple and I never had to enter a code anywhere for the devices to work.  Incidentally, if you decide to use these devices the pin code for both is 0000 if required by your phone or computer.  Oh and both devices worked with Siri on the iPhone.  I was pleasantly surprised how well both functioned.  Also, both headset adapters came with headphones that have a short cable... This is very nice because it allows for the wearer to have the clip where it can be reached without 4 foot of extra cable hanging about.

  Sony:  I have to say that the display is the nicest feature of this device.  It shows when you need pairing and when the device is connected.  It shows the time on the display once connected to my phone and while playing the track is displayed as well.  When using the next or previous buttons, it also shows what's happening as well. Also, the battery indicator is always present on the display as the battery graph most phones have today.  After playing with the basic functions of the headset, I found that everything was very well done except the volume buttons.  I guess you really can't call them buttons and it's not really a slide either.  The surface is flat and has very slight marking indicating + and - and you slide your finger in the direction of either to turn it up or down.  Two things about this make this a really by design.  1) You can't figure out which is which by feel.  Without looking at the device it is hard to figure out how to turn up or down the volume.  2) It is very easy to change the volume accidentally while handing the device.  Since this design doesn't work with an indentation or some other means of force, while holding the device to look at the time you can easily change the volume of your music/call/radio.  This device supports multiple devices so when pairing with a computer and a phone you don't have to pair each time you use it.  Not sure how useful this item really is, but could be nice for those that use more than one device to connect to their headphones.  Volume changes on the headset does change the volume on the phone.  This is nice for the fact that you can change the volume from either the phone or the headset and the volume indicators are the same.

  Samsung: The coolest feature of this device is the voice prompts.  Immediately on startup you have a Voice Prompt of Power On.  Further, it goes into pairing mode and gives you the code while waiting for you to connect.  A nice feature as you don't have to look up anything.  When you flip the switch, it gives you a voice prompt of Power Off...  It seems a bit basic, but it is actually nice when you have the confirmation without having to look at the device to tell if it's on or off.  (BTW, you can turn off the Voice Prompts.)  The button layout seems to be setup nicely for operating everything by touch.  All buttons are slightly different places or offset in comparison to other buttons, so it makes it easy to determine which side of the device and which button you are actually going to depress.  My biggest disappointment here is Sound Alive feature.  While some people may like their bluetooth devices to control EQ, I do not.  If I want to adjust the EQ, I want my Music Player to do it... So this feature means that when you press the button, the audio changed to add or remove Bass.  While I can see this being useful on Phone calls, this button works all of the time, so I have to be careful to not turn on the feature.  This is one of those items I would prefer a press and hold to enable it.  The feature I like best on this phone is the volume control.  Unlike the Sony, I can change the volume on the phone and the headset adapter independently.  This gives me a very nice granular control of how loud or soft I can make the volume.  When using the IEMs (In Ear Monitors) this feature is very nice.  I can turn down the volume enough to sleep with at home or turn it up enough to work at noisy environments equally.  I can see how some people wouldn't like this, but since my IEMs have 26 DB of sound attenuation, I have a very quiet noise floor to start from and I can thereby keep my music volume very low while maintaining a good volume in ear. This keeps my hearing in tact while allowing for a very enjoyable listening experience.

Audio Quality:
  Let me start on this section with a bit of theory and human nature.  First, I am an audio engineer for a medium sized church and I do live sound mixing 8 hours a week.  Further, I have to train others to run the mixer for live sound often enough that I know a thing or two about how people perceive sound.  Since most people don't listen for hours on end to the details that comprise music (IE how well the drum mix works with the vocal mix, etc) and since most people can't hear the difference between the 128Kbps and the 256Kbps MP3s they get from Amazon or elsewhere, I am not going into an expanded discussion on how good or bad these are.  I am not saying that people won't notice that something is different, I am saying they won't know what is different or how the difference effects their music experience.  Since all of the audio sources I used are from 256Kbps encoded sources, I am sure that the limit of the technology of the music source is the biggest limiting factor in the audio quality and therefore all comparisons are extremely subjective unless I were to grab lossless files and spend hours listening to the same songs over and over in order to give a details analysis of how good the Bluetooth transmits those high bandwidth songs.  Long story short, please forgive me for not going into detail about the entirety of the audio quality and using generalizations instead.

  Sony:  The audio quality of these adapters were quite adequate and I couldn't hear any significant loss of fidelity using my IEMs with this device and plugging into the iPhone.  I will say that the Sony headphones provided with the device were a pleasant surprise.  Normally Sony likes to drive their Bass much more than everything else as most people like to bring the Bass out when listening to their music.  These headphones were actually quite flat and for single drivers were very decent for daily use.  I did also try these while sleeping and they fit nicely in the ear to allow for you to put them in on the plane and take a nap.  Also, the headphones were comfortable and didn't hurt after long use.  The headphones do isolate but not nearly as much as my IEMs.  However, for daily use at work or about town, that's probably a good thing.  The only thing about these headphones I disliked was that the short part of the cord was on my left while the device when clipped to my shirt faced the cable to the right... This made for some tugging on the left, while not having any problems on the right.  Also, the audio quality of the phone calls made with this device was as good as any wired headphones I have tried.  Overall, the audio quality on these were quite sufficient for daily use, but if you are the serious audiophile, you are probably listening with High Quality Monitors and Lossless Music and these aren't for you.

  Samsung:  The audio with this adapter and my IEMs were amazing considering the technology behind streaming music wirelessly.  I think that stems from how the bluetooth on these function and the profiles it supports.  Since these are newer, one would expect some improvement over other models that are much older and these don't disappoint.  The headphones that come with these are pretty much worthless.  They don't provide much in the way of isolation and they are so obviously single drivers.  I am not sure how much people would buy either of these devices because of the headphones packaged with the devices, but with a build quality like this from Samsung, they are better off dropping the headphones in the package and bringing the price of this device down some more.  It would certainly probably help with the reviews from people complaining about audio quality.  Call Audio was also decent.  Again, I would say that daily use of this device would be very adequate. If pressed to give a nod to either of these devices on audio alone, I would choose the Samsung providing that you don't use the included headphones.

The Work Test:
  This is what my planned use for these devices is and this is really where I need to see how these function.  I didn't do as much prep on this as I did with everything else, so this section is mainly my preferences and my expectations of the device.

  Sony:  My initial problems with the volume didn't turn out to be a problem while working.  I only had to adjust the volume once as most of the time, I just removed the headphones when needed.  Also, my initial praise for the display turns out to be misguided as well.  I never once went to the headset display to do anything.  Since I needed to press a button on the phone to accept forwarded calls from work, I just picked up the phone each time thereby making the display unimportant.  Also, the clip did turn out to be a problem, but only because of the Sony headphones.  If I were using something else, I think the clip would be ok, but as it was, the left ear headphone will pull the device from my shirt.  I finally swapped the headphones from left and right and solved my problem.  Also, since I synced these with my computer, I had to go through the interface to change everything back to phone from computer just to see the time and have Siri working again.  Not a huge deal, but it keeps it from being useful that I can connect this device to multiple sources.

  Samsung:  Overall, these worked best for how I do my daily work and allowed for me to use Siri, answer the phone and listed to music without getting my headset tangled in coats, desks, etc.

Overall, I give the edge to Samsung as they are 33% less than the Sony's, have slightly a better sound and work better for what I need than the Sony's.  Honestly though, either device is actually very good considering the cost and either should work for anyone that is looking to get their cables out of the way while still using cabled headphones.  I give them both 4 stars (Amazon represents this as I Like It and I do.)

Quick Update (5 Mar 2012):

The Samsung button being indented instead of sticking out is very annoying after much more use.. Also, I have found with the current version of Audible for the iPhone, neither headset seems to control the audio once playback begins.  So I can hit play and the audiobook will play, but I can't pause, forward or back.  These functions seem to work while not playing (as I can skip forward or back chapters), but I can't get them to work once playback starts.  Very annoying and I am hoping that this is addressable via Audible update as it works fine with music.

Also, per a question from the comments here, the Samsung does NOT announce the caller with it's built in voice prompt system.  Both headsets will play the ringtones through the headset though, so if you assign a ringtone to your contacts, you will know whom is calling.  On the iPhone, this works great even if the ringer is turned off, so it's a great feature.

As I purchased both for this review, I am contemplating keeping both as I do really like some features of each...  I'll update again when I decide, but in the mean time, please keep posting questions for me as I'll try to find the answer for you.",Sony WM600 vs Samsung HS3000,1330128000,218.0,,

Overview
=========
The T325 easily connected to my non-smartphone (Samsung Alias 2). I also bought a 2nd one for my father who is using a non-smartphone.

When it works, the instant auto-connection is great. It has also been helpful for my non-techie father. The audio is relatively clear and I've had no complaints from the people I call. (But note that audio quality isn't good when calling another person who is also using a T325).

The battery life is decent. The charger only connects to your cigarette lighter so you can't charge it at home. When charging from your car, it isn't very safe to have the coiled cord dangle in front of your face from your sunvisor so you'll need to charge it while it's resting on your dashboard or elsewhere.

The Problems
=============
Some reviewers did not have the problem of losing the connection with the phone. Unfortunately, I have had the problem with 4 units (2 units for myself and 2 for my father).

On average, the connection does not reliably work after 2 weeks. We have exchanged the units and the results are the same. After making one call, the next call cannot be made without shutting the T325 off and then turning it on again. Another recent problem is that even after powering the T325 off and on again, it could not find my phone.

You can imagine how dangerous this can be if you try and fix this while driving. The connection problems are a distraction and defeat the purpose of having a hands-free device.

On a separate note, I have heard that the T325 will not work properly if left overnight in a car during freezing weather. When it reaches room temperatures again it will work normally... that is if you don't have the connection problems.

The Tedious Fix
================
I've found the following to keep my T325 working. Every 2 weeks (or sooner) reset it to its factory settings, erase the T325 profile from the phone, and then pair them again. To reset to factory settings:

1. Erase the T325 profile from your phone's Bluetooth menu.
2. While the T325 is off, press and HOLD a volume button and the small button with the microphone icon (the one used for Bing) then while those buttons are held down, slide the power switch to the ON position. You will get an audio confirmation that the factory settings are restored. It will then be in pairing mode.
3. Put your phone on discovery mode to pair with the T325.

All of this will take roughly 5 minutes. If you find this too annoying or time consuming, then you may want to try another Bluetooth speaker.

Still Interested?
=================
Be sure to keep your complete packaging in case you want to exchange it. Amazon is very nice about this. They will send you a replacement unit before receiving yours back. But please be sure that your T325 actually shipped from Amazon. If you buy it from a 3rd party on Amazon, then you can expect the exchange/refund policy will not be as generous. As for repairing this with Motorola's warranty, you will need to pay for shipping to Motorola.

(it's a bit aggravating but nothing to harsh to take it down a star.  when you push on it you can feel when it is sitting properly and sometimes it's hard to get the earplug cover into the correct spot but once done it was ok.  so mainly the case i had only had problems when I wasn't paying attention and did not put it on or close it properly.  there are ridges along the side that the outer cover can slip into to hold it still and in place.  if it is installed correctly and it is still loose i would recommend returning it because it probably is defected.",great case to protect your ipod touch!,1301961600,3.0,,

First thing's first though. Putting this case on, you'll find that it fits perfectly around the phone. It fits easily, without actually falling out when you don't want it to. There is also a lifting edge around the screen, so that it doesn't contact the surface you set it on (I think this is pretty standard now).

The one gripe I have is that the microphone, next to the usb charging port, is partially covered by the case. This is nothing a razor can't fix, but it's disappointing that it wasn't engineered perfectly!

The reason I switched to this case from the D30 was because of the buttons, they were covered by the D30 and not easy to press. Cutouts are a huge plus and make the phone feel a lot easier and funner to use. However, when compared to the D30, the Diztronic feels a bit flimsy and lacking in the protection area.

All in all, I like the case, especially for the price! But I may try keep looking as new cases come out (Incipio looks promising).

**** EDIT 1/6/2012
Changing to 5-star because they listened and made the hole on the bottom of the phone bigger to make room for the microphone. Also, I ended up switching to the D30 for a while, but couldn't stand the largeness of it, or the annoyance of having to press the buttons so hard. I'm sticking with this case for a while.","Comfortable, convenient, but is it durable?",1322697600,6.0,,

The desk stand that Samsung sells is perhaps a bit ""neater"" in appearance, but I heard it doesn't work with the phone encased.

This one works great as far as I'm concerned, it seems to be an authentic Samsung product (arrived in original packaging) and has the added bonus of getting you a second battery!

Extra bonus - it included another wall charger. The charger that came with my phone was a wall USB power adapter and a data cord, which was fine. But now I also have a dedicated microUSB AC adapter, so I can take my USB power adapter and other cord to work and also bring my iPod cable to charge up multiple devices there; this saved me another purchase as I was planning to buy a USB adapter for this as well! (Some people have mentioned getting a branched power cord with this that could charge both the extra battery and the phone at the same time, I did not get this with mine but I'm ok with that.)

Some of the other reviews were from people that could not get the new battery to work - I would advise you to check your Samsung battery to ensure that it is a match. I guess there are a couple of different models of battery in use by the variety of Galaxy S phone types out there. If you have a Mesmerize like me I assume it should work fine like mine. I can't tell the difference between the new battery and the stock one, they both have equally good charge (of course I just got the phone as well so they are both pretty new batteries).

All told, this was a great purchase for me from this seller. Unfortunately, I've noticed that Amazon has a tendency to switch out the ""active"" seller on these main product pages so you may be buying from a different place unless you click their link to see the listing of all sellers.

They have to be something that isn't black so I can find it in my car or purse.  Although this is a deep plum, it still stands out.

5.0,True,2012-01-06,AF5MYIR1E75L8,B003ZX7RNC,{'Color:': ' Grey'},jb in sd,"I bought the Nokia N8 for my mom for Christmas because it had all the things she wanted (touch screen phone, smart phone, mp3 player, and to combine devices such as her excellent camera). Alas, she didn't want it (likes her simple flip better, easier to hold, and she doesn't like touch screen for a phone, just for an mp3 player)

But ....

I DIG it. It is smaller than the E7, which is a beast in comparison. Camera is amazing, flash blinding.

Other awesome factors:
! HDMI out
! USB on the go
FM transmitter - so simple, but so so convenient
storage <- 16gb built in + 32gb on microsd = 48gb (plus usb)

Data access is very controllable. Maps can update via sms (or network, or simple unassisted GPS). You can set priority of data access to favor wifi, or whatever priority for many access points (wifi, 3g, network, etc). Manage data. Cool. I say, get this phone, and go for a cheap GSM plan.

Notes:
1. came with Symbian^3, but not Anna. Anna makes the difference. If Anna hadn't updated, I would definitely have returned it. Lusting for Belle.
2. camera protector - it ships with a camera protector for shipping. Remove this thing or your photos will be super hazy.

Get these apps:
Nokia apps: Situations, Panorama, PlayTo, Here and Now, Big Screen, Reader (but, don't subscribe to too much it will drive you crazy if a widget), Map, Drive, Places (pretty cool)
Noka beta apps: Live View (frikkin awesome)
3rd party, best: Fring (forward facing camera, google voice integration, etc, second favorite 3rd party), Opera Mini or Mobile (favorite 3rd party app), Wordpress
3rd party, non-Ovi: Books (from Meego project, not sure who the developer is)

It's kind of slippery. I think anyone who gets it will have to get some kind of protector case.

Drat:
1) I haven't found a way to turn on the camera flash as a flashlight like my E7 (and pretty much all my other old Nokes handsets would) will do (hold screen lock for like 5 sec till it comes on/off)
2) no Kindle app
3) no Netflix of Hulu
4) no Meego :( why Nokia why? so sad (tho Anna is good)

BELLE UPDATE;
Belle is very pretty. It seems to improve performance (speed). Books (which I previously got from Meego site) now appears in the updated Nokia Store. Nokia Live View (beta app) is now Nokia City Scape.

UPDATE (2012-0610):
Still love the phone after 6 mo.
Why? Several reasons.
Amazing camera.
Lots of photo & music/sound editing capability onboard (with each Symbian version), gps voice navigation the same quality as a stand alone unit (this alone makes it worth the purchase), FM extras (radio and radio out). Also, the autocorrect/predictive text is better than my ipod touch, by several orders of magnitude, which really surprises me. Also like the large onboard and very large expandable memory. And HDMI out. And built in backup options.
Perpetual annoyances: not Meego (so sad so sad), no Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video, no Kindle app. There are ways to Get Around each of these annoyances, but, well, if it had Meego there would be no need. Hoping Nokia/Accenture merges Meego with the goodies of the other open source platforms (WebOS & Meego/Tizen) and resurrects in house OS. But not holding my breath on that one. Also, strangely, the phone likes to spontaneously reboot; is this due to my carrier (TMo)? full phone memory? What's that about? I have the feeling it may be carrier related, but again, no bets there.
I've got a family plan, with an ancient data plan which is very cheap. And in this case, there are very few options out there with better value (than using this unlocked user-controlled phone).",Nokia N8 - awesome phone!!,1325808000,7.0,,

Strip and crimp the center wire (positive and usually marked with a strip or white marks on the cable but use a DMM to make sure) to the ""add a fuse"".  In the vehicle, find a fuse that is same or of higher amperage than the fuse with the ""add a fuse"".  Remove it and insert the ""add a fuse"" and insert the removed fuse in the ""add a fuse"".  Strip and run the other wire to ground (bolt or screw or something that is grounded).  Route the cable of this charger to the socket and insert.

& I have to tell you WebOs is the best operating system out there. It's such a shame is was ended.

The only way the other OS systems beat this phone (not including Blackberry) is
1) Apps
2) 3rd party accessories
3) Media ( Camera & Video )

If those 3 things are not high ranking on your hunt for smart phone, any webOS device is the phone for you.
1st off, it's under $50 dollar so even if your iphone or android phone breaks, it's good to have a substitute while you wait for a new one.

Because the Apps aren't there, its easy to say it cant do as much as the other top OS *NOT TRUE*

For only $.99 You can put preware on your WebOS device. Essentially this is hacking your phone. There us almost now danger in bricking your phone. And if by some fluke you do, there are easy ways to get your device running back to normal.
But by hacking my phone, I made it's signature of that of an iphone, so when ever I go to a site it will bring up special options only for an iphone.

I was even able to get Google Maps on my device.

The OS system is a real underrated gem and everyone should try it out. If you email a lot this phone is great for you. The keypad is awesome and makes it easy to blast out long text or emails.
The OS string point is multitasking. You can have several apps running in the background and easily switch them with a flick of your finger literally.

This screen protector went on easier than any other - as many have already said - and I've put on scores of these things for myself, family, and friends.

As anyone who's ever applied one knows, trying to get it on with perfect alignment is a bear- you get the bottom button lined up and then the ear speaker or camera hole is off, or vice versa. Normally, if you don't get it 100% right on the first try, you have to lift it off (even partially) and - bam - it's a static dust magnet and you end up with bubbles caused by dust particles.

Not here. I was able to get it aligned perfectly in 2 tries... the stiffer nature of this guard also helped - and was even able to lift it up to clean off 1 piece of dust - without attracting 100 more!

The matte finish is why I'm reducing by 1 star. And I feel a little guilty about it- it should only be 1/2 a star away from perfect.

This guard has, hands-down, the best matte finish I've ever seen. It looks good, it feels great. I've gone through many types of anti-glare coated protectors on my iPads and TouchPads and other phones - even a large one for my 23"" TouchSmart PC - and all exhibit the same pixelation effect, some better and some worse. This one has it - but it's much less noticeable than most.

The good - it makes the phone much easier to see with light bouncing off of it - office lights, sunlight. The bad - there is a slight degradation in crispness. You will notice it because the images on the phone are just a tiny bit blurry. With a solid white background you will see a slight rainbow effect. It's not horrible, or even ""really bad"" - but if you bought your iPhone for the Retina display and expect that level of crispness and clarity, you're going to be giving a little bit of that up.

Not that sexy, but a great backup or temporary case (for me, a tide-me-over until Apple comes through with their free offer).

Mine came with a clear screen protector, which was a nice surprise. I didn't see that mentioned in the description, so I don't know if the seller just threw it in as a bonus.

Even without the screen protector, this case is a great deal.

UPDATE: It seems that with the case on, pictures with flash don't always take properly. There is a hole exposing the rear camera lens and flash, but the flash reflects off the inner edge of the silicone which causes a white ring to appear at the outside borders of some photos. Pictures without flash are unaffected, and the case does slip on and off easily, so it's not that big a deal (but something to be aware of if you rely on the flash a lot).","Perfectly good no-frills case, a real bargain",1279756800,7.0,,

Before bying ZAGG for my Nexus at first I was hesitant to get it because that people said about protector being sticky, but stock Verizon screen protector I bought was giving me rainbow effects on view surface. So I bought ZaGG, and boy, was I happy with my purchase. Even though it looks weird on the side (slight-ripple fishskin-effect surface) and slightly odd to touch, when you look directly at it, it is invisible !!! It is so clear, it is amazing. And later I found out from using it, it only is sticky, if you fingers are oily or wet. If you have clean fingers, it slides just fine. P.S. Looks like it is unscratchable too. P.P.S During the protector install I was in the bathroom full of steam, that avoided any flying dust to be electrostatically attracted to the inner side of the film during install.

01/08/2013 - Update
Upgraded to ZaGG HD, very happy. Finger-tips slide easier on HD, less fish-skin ripple effect on the surface (surface is almost smooth, few very imperceptible blemishes visible only if you look very close at an angle). After 6 months or more of use haven't scratched the surface yet, even after occasional contact with keys in the pocket.

02/23/13 - Update from comments
The whole point of having installation done in the bathroom full of steam is that all flying micro-particles are removed from surrounding air by micro-droplets of water (that what steam is), and they have no chance to stick to the side of the film facing the screen - because once they stick to it, you will see them while using the phone, and you will not be able to remove them. It takes virtually a second for the air dust to pretty much cover the film, that was my observation then I tried first to perform install without steam. With steam - there is no dust in the air, it is all gone into the water mist, I have not had a single lint or dust piece on any of the 3 screens I installed in the steam environment. So no, I think by the time you have sprayed StaticCling, you will have contaminated screen inside surface with visible air-derived particles.","Screen so clear you wonder if protector is there, comfortable to touch",1341619200,19.0,,

The cup holder version works but it's in a horrible position and not even visible while I drive. The other was one that plugged into my cigarette lighter outlet but it was too low and out of the way to again be viewable. I then tried a vent clip type, which worked, but wasn't very stable and pretty much blocked the vent. I also didn't like blowing hot air onto the phone. Now, all of these devices did work and do what they said they would, but none simply worked properly in my car.

This brings us to this cradle,  which is genius in its design. If you think about it, most cd player slots are right smack dab in an easy to see and reach spot. My only concern was ""how on earth would it get held into place?"" The pictures aren't very clear and there isn't much explanation as to the mechanics of it. (I will post some pictures so you can see what I'm about to explain.)

The design is very simple and works like a charm. There is a one inch-ish tab that runs close to the length of the cd slot. It's broken up into 4 tabs and there is a knob you twist after inserting it into the slot. When you turn this knob 2 of the 4 tabs separate from the other two (up and down) making the entire tab ""thicker"" so it applies some pressure and keeps it held into place. This part that slides into the cd slot (or any other slot you may see on your dash) is made of a soft plastic, but bendable material. It won't hurt your cd player.

There is also access to the bottom of the iPhone so I can charge it while it's sitting in the cradle. The cradle is also adjustable so you can get it pointing at you or your passenger. It simply pivots, no need to screw or tighten anything for this. The area where the back of the phone rests on the cradle is a very soft, foamy pad and the parts that grab onto the sides of the phone are also soft and foamy.

Anyway, I couldn't be happier to have found something that works so well. It was shipped quickly, priced right, and is well made. I will throw up some pictures later...","FINALLY!!!

I've tried half-a-dozen different headphone and none of them feet so unfortunately I feel like I need to knock a couple of stars off. It's a shame.

Update: Given the manufacturer's response and my own experience with cases that have camera/flash cutouts that are too small and therefore cause flash reflections I am revising my review and giving Diztronic the benefit of the doubt and rating the item 5 stars.

At this price the Diztronic iPhone 5 case is a great deal. It fits the body perfectly and the cutouts for headphone, speakers, mic, volume, power and lightning connector are almost perfect. One small quibble though: the camera and flash cutout is slightly too large on the bottom and exposes some of the aluminum back. It's also important to note that because of the tight fit and the lip that overhangs the screen it may be tough to use a screen protector on the case.

But overall, for what I paid this is a great case. It's light, simple, and a perfect fit. I bought it thinking that it would tide me over until better iPhone 5 cases come to market but I just may keep it on indefinitely.

#1. The case is not made of TPU, or at least my understanding of what TPU is. It's a jelly skin case (the black part) with a hard plastic clip on shell (the blue part). The areas on the side of the phone that are not supported by the Blue shell are somewhat loose and do not fit snugly. I'm afraid this would allow for dirt and lint to get in between the case and the phone.

#2. My biggest disappointment comes from the fact that the case fit too tight over the power button and it kept restarting my phone because it would put pressure on the power button. The only way to avoid this was to cut out the black jelly skin over the power button area. Unfortunately this made the power button difficult to access (though not impossible).",Disappointed,1356825600,3.0,,

I opted for the Otterbox over the Seidio due to increased protection. Nearly every surface on the phone is covered with this case, and it has covers for the ports.  I also like the beveling of the slider cover to minimize the intrusion into the keyboard.  The only thing I don't like is how slick it is.  If it had the same texture as the Seidio case or even the Droid without a case it would hands down be the best case for the Droid.

Edit: Otterbox customer service is top-notch.  I had a fitment issue with my case and they had another one at my door within 72 hours.  It's nice to see the art of customer service is not lost.

Prices will go up as sales decline, and so will taxes thanks to the elected big government advocates and those who keep them in office. I simply have nothing to benefit from Amazon's business anymore.

Worldwide Distributors is a Marketplace vendor for Amazon and is also a good reason to find another source for your cell phone needs. They claim to be a California based company and so charged me tax on this order before the Amazon September 15 deadline. California based companies typically have my packages delivered to me within two days. However, there was no  indication that this product was going to be shipped from Florida. Now a week later it is still in transit.

For some reason it takes four days for this company to prepare its shipments when bigger companies often have my orders shipped out on the very same day. I then asked them to send my package with USPS since both FedEx and UPS have a record of losing my packages, but some companies have no concern for your needs despite the little statement they send out saying:

""Our goal is for you to be completely satisfied with this transaction"".

Uh, well, this is the curt reply I received back to my request:

""We do not ship this item via USPS, it will be shipped FEDEX for international and UPS for states thank you.""

Yep, that is a real attempt to satisfy a customer.  No?

So now I have to wait for nearly two weeks for this item to arrive after its excursion across the US because Worldwide Distributors is too cheap to take a couple of dollars of the huge profit they are making off this sale and provide overnight or second day service as they would do for their friends. Now under the care of UPS, the chances of this high interest item getting lost are tripled when it passes through the notoriously evil downtown LA distribution center. Ever wondered why your UPS packages look so beat up when delivered?

So, Worldwide Distributors, don't ever expect to get any favorable review from me.

The Samsung Galaxy S3 is second in popularity to the Apple iPhone. It is highly praised for its abilities, many of which are better than what the iPhone is capable of, and covered to a greater extent by real experts.

4.0,True,2012-09-11,A3VX645S4CGAR6,B00SZ2N4YY,,Sarah,"I bought one to try it out and I'm ordering another tonight for the other car. It is working just as I had expected. It was a little hard to figure out how to get it attached and adjusted at first (there aren't really instructions) but once I got it figured out it was fine. I wasn't sure how well the vent clip thing would work but I'd had the suction cup ones before and they'd often come loose on me so I wanted to try a new mechanism. This actually worked better than I expected and feels quite stable. I'm not worried about it flying loose if I take a sharp turn or stop quickly as I had happen with other mounts.

I had also been worried about finding a holder big enough for my galaxy s3 and the case it is in. This one has more than enough room. I like that it has buttons you can press to quick release the side clips. This makes it so I can clamp the phone in nice and tight without worrying about having a hard time getting it out later.

One thing I did find odd/annoying is that the right/left clips extend so far forward. It's almost like the phone has blinders. Generally in the car, I want to arrange it in a way that both my boyfriend and I can see the phone - so I can control music, etc and he can see the gps navigation. The seemingly excessive depth of those clips makes it more difficult to find an angle where we can both see it well. I don't know of any device that's quite that thick so I don't know why they extend out so far. especially since the tabs at the bottom are far shorter so you couldn't completely hold anything that wide. So anyway, a quirk, but overall this is working well for me so I'm going to order another and I would recommend it if you're looking for something to hold your phone in the car.

Update 7/17/13:
A couple of weeks ago, the clip broke off on one of the two of these that I own. I suspect it grew weak because i was adjusting the phone angle occasionally without loosening the dial. I happen to own a 3-d printer so I'm just going to use the non-broken one to model the part I broke and print it out. I guess I'm not personally too upset about it because I suspect it is my own fault, and I can fix it myself, but I figured it is worth mentioning as a warning to others.

Also, at some point I got a new case for my phone and it stopped holding quite as well. Like the perfect hold would have been between 2 clicks. It still held mostly well and wouldn't have been a problem except that I live on a dirt road and it gets very bumpy after heavy rain, causing the phone to sometimes jar loose. So mileage may vary as far as how tight the grip on the phone is.

Pretty easy to put on, fully encases my iPhone. The only negative aspect is that since the case covers the volume buttons, it can be hard to press these buttons when the case is in use. My solution was simple, cut some tape, overlap them to increase overall thickness, then cut out a tiny square of it (the size of each volume button) then stick it to the inside of the case where the button rest. The idea is to bridge the gap between the iPhone button and the case. It protects very well against drops, which has happened about 2-3 times. In fact, the drop was silent because the TPU material cushioned it so well from the fall. I believe this case is far superior to hard plastic, which can crack or snap off from the device, or a thin layer of silicone, which may not provide adequate protection. It even shields the device (not full protect of course) from the occasional splash of water (or bodily fluid), which is definitely good for a physician / healthcare personnel working in the hospital setting.

This silicone case does the job of protecting the phone. however, the material of the case is what i have fault with.

FINALLY I've found the perfect headset.

Update 11/15/12:  This headset is still going strong, and continues to impress me.  I've been using it in really noisy locations lately (airports, cars with the windows down) and the sound is still great.  I actually bought one as a gift for a friend and have been equally impressed with the sound quality as a caller.  He calls from his car (windows down!) and I hear him no problem.  I did notice that I could hear the cars going by when he was out walking on a busy street one or twice, but much less than I would have expected.  Overall, this continues to be my go-to headset.

Original review:

Fit/comfort:  My old 520 fit so well I could forget I was wearing it, so that's what I expected out of the new, high-end headsets I tried.  The Voyager Pro would randomly fall out of my ear when I was talking, and the BlueAnt was extremely uncomfortable (no matter which adapter I used).  The Motorola is pretty comfortable, but the Bose wins hands-down for both comfort and security of fit.  The rubber insert is pliant, and has an interesting ""spur"" that seems to stabilize the unit without being at all uncomfortable.  WINNER:  Bose, with Motorola as the runner-up

Reception:  Callers told me the BlueAnt and Voyager both sounded static-y, even in a quiet room.  There were frequent digital ""blips"" that cut the sound with them, too.  The Motorola had less of a problem with this, but the Bose has zero issues.  WINNER:  Bose

Call quality (receiving):  All the headsets received calls just fine, but only the Bose sounds completely clear and static-free.  The Motorola was a close second, but Bose has the edge.  WINNER:  Bose, Motorola runner-up

Ease of use:  All paired with no problems, have intuitive buttons, and simple displays.  Two failed this category, though:  BlueAnt and Motorola.  The BlueAnt had bells and whistles that just got in my way - for example instead of the tapping ""call"" button and saying ""call [number]"" like the 520 did, I had to ask for ""Voice Commands"" and wait for the headset to activate the phone's in-built voice commands (which it also had to repeat every time).  For someone who uses the headset a lot, this is a nuisance for every single call.  The Motorola, on the other hand, actually failed to do some of things it promised (see my review for more on this).  WINNER:  Tie between Bose and the Voyager

Form factor:  This is a really minor category for me, but the tiny size of the Bose makes it lighter and easier to transport.  The Voyager is HUGE compared to other headsets, while the other two are somewhere in between.  The Motorola does have a very nice folding feature to turn the unit on/off, so this function gives it a small edge over the Bose.  WINNER:  Motorola

Some users may care about two things that should be noted:  1) the Bose is ear-specific - so you can't switch left or right - and 2) it doesn't play media.  I don't need either of these features since I use this in my car, so I'm fine with that.

The earlier fault may well have been user error, but it randomly started playing media the other day in the car and has done so consistently ever since.  Sound is equally clear and static-free.

Being an iPhone guy from day one, I set out to find a used iPhone and realized that they hold their value pretty well.  Out of my try-it-to-see-if-you-like-it budget.

Then I found this Android phone and decided for the money it wouldn't be a complete bust if she hated it.  Ordered it and it was on its way.

As I mentioned, I'm an iPhone guy.  I've had friends try to convince me Android was a good platform, but I've always pooh-poohed that.  I tried out some of the early Android phones (way back in the Cupcake days) and was NOT impressed.  I remained confident that my iPhone was the ONLY way to go.

After putting the battery in and powering up the Avail, I was able to quickly connect to my WiFi network to complete setup (I hadn't put my wife's SIM in yet).  After setting her Google account up and answering a few questions about my location & time zone, I was into the phone.

And you know what?  I was fairly impressed with what Android has evolved into.  Navigation worked well, the screen animations were reasonably smooth.  I was able to figure out how to add & remove icons from the various pages.  Android has become an OS that an iPhone user can pickup (probably vice versa too) and with only a few differences feel completely at home.

The phone itself is very nice for the money.  The size is about the same as the iPhone in width & length, but the screen is a touch smaller and the overall thickness is a little more.  But the Avail feels really nice in the hand.  It's got a good weight and the battery cover feels slightly rubberized and grippy (my biggest complaint with the iPhone is the glass back is slippery as all get out).

I was able to throw some apps on the phone easily and they worked as expected.

After giving my wife a crash course in smartphoneology I told her to play with it and see how she likes it.  So far so good & she likes texting MUCH better on a phone with a full keyboard than on her old flip phone with only number keys!

Pros
* Cost can't be beat for an unsubsidized phone.  If you have an AT&T account you can pop your SIM in and go!
* Android has actually gotten pretty nice
* Phone feels good in the hand, doesn't feel flimsy or cheap
* Can increase storage w/ larger SD card

Cons
* Only 5MP camera
* Less on board memory than a higher-end phone
* Only comes with 2GB SD card
* Screen doesn't feel as smooth as other phones I've used - screen protectors should help & are on the way
* Occasional slowness in opening an app or navigating, but very minor","As an iPhone guy, color me impressed",1333065600,37.0,,

My journeys take me to Asia on occasion. On this particular trip I went to mainland China, Korea and Hong Kong. Three different plugsets..

First to clear up some things I've seen on the reviews:
It DOES work on a 220 network.
It DOES NOT convert voltage to 110. Make sure everything you plug into it can handle 220 or the magic smoke will get out and your device will no longer work.
It works in the USA, Hong Kong, Korea and Mainland China (probably more)

Design
I thought the design was quite innovative and attractive. Everything is self contained, slides out, no adapters to loose. Even has a fuse.

In use it worked pretty well, though a couple of minor issues.
-The fuse is on the back (business end) of the unit, pressure applied wrong while fumbling can cause the cover to come off and fuse to pop out. Consider tape.
-While flexible it is a tad flimsy, the way the orientation worked out when plugged into the wall and then a power strip plugged into it sometimes it came out. Some work was required to keep it in.

The first one I purchased was this one on Amazon, so I could decide if I wanted to switch from an Android device to a Windows Phone.  Needless to say I was blown away.  I was always a fan of the flexibility of Android, and loved adding custom software and Roms to my phone.  My wife on the other hand just wanted a phone that worked consistently.  Her HTC Mytouch4G was getting slow and buggy, so I decided to have her try a Windows phone since I had heard nothing but good things (We are on Cincinnati Bell, so an iPhone was not an option.  Although I don't think I would have chosen that over the Radar anyway).  When my wife got her Windows phone she loved the interface, and the integration with Facebook.  She didn't like that MyFitness Pal app didn't have a barcode scanner (it does now), and that there is no Words with Friends (still isn't), but those were small gripes in comparison to having a phone that didn't hang and need to be rebooted daily.  Speaking of daily, under typical usage neither of our Android devices would last more than 8 hours on a charge.  The Windows phone will go a day and a half (still no blackberry) but much better.  Well, as you may have guessed, I gave up my modded Android HTC G2 for a Radar as well, and haven't regretted it for a second.  Having your hands on one of these things is believing.  If you get a chance to try one out take a friend with an android or iphone with you.  Go to Youtube and stream a video, and watch how much faster the Windows phone can do it.  It is really amazing.

Pros:
Slick interface
Just Works
Good Camera (Rear facing)
Decent front camera
Solid HTC build

Cons:
Windows app market much smaller than Android or iPhone

I had the Motorola H720 before this, and the H710 before that, but my car was broken into yet again, and my H720 was stolen. I immediately purchased the newest model of the same Motorola series - this H730 - and am thrilled with it.

First of all, this bluetooth does NOT stick INSIDE your ear. I can't stand the bluetooths that do that. This unit has nothing to stick inside your ear. It is flat and lays flat against your ear. It is also loud and clear so you don't have to worry that you're giving up on sound. As a matter of fact, sometimes it's too loud and you can lower the volume easily. The sound is nice and clear, and there is no lag time - you don't miss the first few seconds of the conversation - it picks up immediately.

The other thing that I really like about this unit is the flip open design for turning it on or off. You flip it open to turn it on, and flip it closed to turn it off. Simple. No guesswork involved. I love the simplicity of it.

This bluetooth has a GREAT battery life, both for talktime and standby.

Another improvement that I really like for this bluetooth over the H720 is that when you first open it, a voice tells you that it is connected, and also tells you if the battery level is high, medium or low. This is a nice improvement over the tone that used to sound in the middle of a call!

Once you use this bluetooth, you won't want to go back to any of the others on the market. I'm spoiled now and can't imagine ever go back to using the others out there. This one is a keeper!

I even bought these for family and friends as gifts and everyone gets hooked and says it's the best bluetooth they have ever had.

(NOTE TO MOTOROLA developers who are reading this: When the H730 is turned on in the middle of a phone call, please cut out the voice saying ""Bluetooth connected."" Right now when I want to put on my H730 in the middle of a call, I have to tell the person to hold on a few seconds while waiting for it to say ""Bluetooth connected"" before resuming my call. There is no purpose for this. Although the H730 cuts out the rest of the voice during the call saying the battery level, please cut this voice out as well when the H730 is opened mid-call, as it interferes with the phone call. I suggest that if the H730 is opened mid-call that you postpone the voice alert saying the battery level and have it speak AFTER the call is completed.

Almost every no name brand screen protector I ever purchased usually come with 3 and cost like $1.99 for all 3.  I wanted to like this product but I never got it to work right.  Unless you install screen protectors for a living or you are really good at it by all means buy it, it works as intended. I followed the directions to the letter making sure i read twice and still had the manual open as I applied it.  Unfortunately my first time i was off by a hair, partially covering the mic on the phone.  When I tried to adjust it naturally it made the whole thing worse.  So I ended up having a good old visible fingerprint that has not gone away...YES I DID WASH MY HANDS, as stated earlier I followed the directions to the teeth.  It does come with a warranty and replacements can be sent for free minus shipping cost.

Any normal person who applies screen protectors once or twice a year (depending on how quickly you replace phones) usually will never get it to line up perfectly the first time.  You have a 50/50 chance of getting it right the first time.  With my luck it is more like 90/10 in favor of getting it wrong.  I usually get it right the second time and for some people they may need a third or forth time. Let's face it at $10+ dollars for one of these it is just not worth the effort. Also like other comments it takes a while for the bubbles to go away mine took a couple of days. After 2 months with it I couldn't stand to look at the fingerprint anymore and got a cheap no name protector at the local electronics store.

I never noticed a difference in the amount of protection or visibility compared to the no name brand I purchased.  I mean honestly how much more protection do you need when the device itself is gorilla glass scratch resistant and kevlar surroundings out of the box. I believe a simple, cheap, ultra clear protector, is fine to prevent micro scratches over periodic use for the life of the phone which nowadays is like 1 to 2 years.

This is easily fixed by readjusting the case on the phone. But the stand is made of good rubberized material that will protect your phone in case of most falls. The stand is a little short, which causes the screen tilts too far back for my taste (I had a Thunderbolt and felt that angle was perfect), but that is just personal taste.

I researched AGAIN, and found this phone. It has actual KEYS!! This phone is AWESOME!! I am about to turn 36 and I want more of an old school phone. I wanted the features of a smartphone, but also be able keep my Go Phone. This phone asks you right up from the get go if you have a data plan. Which I do not. Don't want one. Don't want the fees. Once you press ""no"", the phone sets you at WiFi only. No data will be charged. SWEET!

Now....about the airtime credit. This is not as 1.2.3. easy as At&T makes it sound on their instruction sheet. First, you will need to call 800-331-0500 and enter your Go Phone #. It will then direct you to Go Phone customer service. It will ask you what you want. I chose (after being disconnected from AT&T) my go phone balance. After I heard that, it will ask what you else would you like. I simply said customer service and voila! a real person!! After some wait, of course. In total, I spoke to AT&T 4 times. First, and third reps had NO idea what they were doing and gave me misinformation. Third rep put me on hold so long, she disconnected me. Second rep, I thought hooked me up, but no. He did give me a better rate per min. I was on an old rate plan, and now I am saving money. But rep #4 made my day. You will need the IMEI# found on the back of your phone, or on the box. You can also get this # by entering *#06# on your keypad of your phone. My credit was applied instantly. YEA!!! I did not need to install the new SIM (#1 & #3 reps advised this). You are able to keep your existing SIM. At&T customer service is pretty good. Sometimes it is frustrating, but overall, I am pleased.

Pros
- The armband is removable, so you can use the rubber case as a standalone case for the iPhone 4 if you're so inclined.
- Inserting the iPhone into the rubber case is a breeze: You just slide it in through the open screen area.
- Screen and rear panel protector overlays are included in the event that you don't already have them.
- The screen is exposed, meaning that you don't have to press through some ridiculously thick sheet of rubberized plastic to get at the controls.

Cons
- The screen is exposed.  Yeah, it's a pro, but in the event it's raining?  Quickly becomes a con.  Not entirely sure how the con part of this could be removed, but it's indeed a valid concern.
- Given the serious ease with inserting the iPhone, I'm concerned with how easy it might be able to slip out during a run?  I'll update the review after a run or two with my findings.

Overall
It's a great armband/case combo, and I don't know of any that I'd recommend over it at this point in time.

Update 10/25/10:
- Went out for a run with it, and I'm very impressed.  Still cautious about the screen being exposed in the event that it rains, mists, etc., but that aside, it seems to hold the iPhone in place very well.  Still highly recommended!",Outstanding build quality,1287619200,3.0,,

_____________

I have a mobile powerhouse, aka, super smart phone, my Samsung S Epic 4G! I have unlimited everything plan with Sprint. I make lengthy phone calls, text a lot, have well over 120 apps aboard, I watch the news on my phone, listen to music, check the weather, navigate to new places, update my Facebook status, video chat, scan & shop stuff, check my bank accounts, and most importantly, play plenty of games [Air Attack HD I & II, Hawx, Asphalt 6, Sand Storm, Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds, Cut The Rope, My Paper Plane 2, Tank Recon Full Version, Contract Killer, Stupid Zombies, BIA, sorry but the list just goes on!!] You get the picture. I literally live with my phone in my hand. Oh, right, the problem: my phone loves juice! I can't go a full day of work without worrying when it's gonna give out on me. What's good is any of the above if your Brilliant phone dies on you when you need the most?!! The battery on my phone has limited me to a point of frustration.

My Options:
___________

I went online looking for a solution to this problem. I have run into a couple of products that claim to put an end to my battery-related woes. Each got their strong & weak points. As I considered my options I kept a few things in my mind: 1) My Budget: How much do I want to invest into this? 2) Mobility: Whatever it is, I don't want it to add any junk to the trunk! 3)Longevity: How long is it gonna last me? Will I go a full day away from the power plug? 4) Versatility: If two products reach a tie, whichever says 'Universal"" in the description will weigh down.
Now, let's take a quick look at what I found online:
- Extended Batteries [The Good: They boost your smart phone life. The Bad: They add lots of junk to the trunk!].
-OEM Batteries [The Good: They boost your smart phone life. The Bad: Expensive. They don't offer a complete solution. You still need to stick inside your phone & charge one at the time! Low bang for the Buck ratio.
-External/'Instant' Battery Packs: [The Good: The obvious! The Bad: Inconvenient. Minimally, you have to carry them along with the included cable on you. Mixed up reviews as to how much juice they add up to your phone & how many times they can do that before they need to get recharged. Just too much hassle for me. If you don't know what I talking about here, look up 'Duracell Instant USB Charger' as a good example of this category.
- Solar, AA-battery-based instant charger, & other less known novelties...Well, if any of them proved to be of any practical value, they surely would've made their way to the public attention!

My Choice:
___________

So, I've come across Laza 2x Battery + Travel Charger for Samsung S. series smart phones. It's biggest advantages over other products are:
- Value: Best Bang for the Buck. 2 batteries plus a decent travel charger for $30.
- Small Profile: When used, it adds ZERO junk to your smart phone's booty!
- Day round Juice Supply! You end up having 3 batteries: The original battery, two fully charged & ready to serve when called upon. Oh, you also get a travel charger that you may choose to carry in your car glove compartment, case, lady's purse, or with your laptop :-)
- Solid favorable reviews.
- It comes with a nice little pouch that holds both batteries & slips easily into your pocket.

FYI Section:
__________________________________

- I've had this battery combo for over a month now & I'm very happy with their performance.
- The Batteries are fresh & last long. You charge them fully and two days later, when kept unused, they start @ 95%.
- The charging cycle takes 2-4 hours to get the batteries from zero to hero!
- I've tried to charge Laza Batteries while inside my Epic. It worked, initially but then the phone start acting up [Launching apps & locking the phone] so I stopped doing that. For me, I would've loved to have them charge inside my phone but you can't have it all I guess.
- The LED indicator works perfectly fine when you stick well drained batteries to charge. But say, if you stick half drained battery in there, it may turn blue (indicates being fully charged). The solution is very simple, just reset (unplug & plug back to power).
- Also worth mention: The packaging for this product was great & the manufacturer seems to care about their customers' satisfaction. When you get your package you'll know what I'm talking about.

My Verdict:

5.0,True,2011-07-28,A3KYL2QADZ2C9U,B0053OE3BK,,RPB,"This is a great product, but installation can be a bit tricky.  I would strongly recommend ordering 2x the amount you need as there is a learning curve to putting them on.

Installation:
Let me explain a bit about the product as it might make it easier if you decide to order it.  First, when you take it out of the package, it's actually 3 thing films of plastic sandwiched together.  The 2 outside layers get peeled off and disposed of (order coming in a second), and the one in the middle is the actual product that will be protecting the glass on your phone.  The first step is let the air settle in the room you're going to be in to install the cover. If there is any dust in the air, some of will get stuck to the phone-facing side of the cover as you put it on the phone, which will cause air bubbles.  Turn off all fans, or anything that is stirring up the air before you put the cover on. Step 2:  Clean the phone with a microfiber cloth so there is no dust/oil/etc on it.  Step 3: Peel off the outside film that is closest to the phone (line up the speaker/sensor holes, and peel off the film that is away from you and facing the phone).  Hold the plastic by the edges only! Step 4: Starting at the end with the holes cut in it, line up the top edge of the cover with the top edge of the phone glass and begin to press it down.  This need to happen quickly so you minimize the time for dust to get in between the phone and the cover. Smoothly press the cover onto the phone from top to bottom. Step 5: Using the tab on the remaining film, peel off the remaining film, leaving the cover on the phone.  You've got to use a fingernail to help separate the film from the cover - and do it without bending that corner of the cover. If you bend it, or you have too much dust causing bubbles (up to your tolerance), take it off and try again with a new one.  You can get almost all the air out, even if there's dust by firmly pressing with the side of you thumb and pushing the air toward the closest edge.  I ended up with 2 bubbles less than 1mm each on mine and called it good.

Performance:
Your screen will collect more oil from fingers/face with this product installed.
There is slightly more friction with this product vs. bare phone, so you will have to adjust your taps/swipes just a little.
I got over both of these in the first day, and it's now now longer a problem.
I've had the cover installed just over a month and so far no scratches or haze can be noticed on the cover - seems quite durable so far.

If you're concerned about scratching your screen (my son's had a small scratch within the first week while we were waiting for the covers to finally arrive), this is a good way to go.  Once you get over the installation, you should be in good shape.",Good Cover - Order Extra,1311811200,27.0,,

The swipe to multitask and swipe to close is so natural that you will find yourself trying to do it on other OS's (iOS and Android) and becoming frustrated as its not as smooth and you have to press buttons...

Overall the OS is buttery smooth and the visuals are beautiful.

Pros:
* Beautiful device
* 1GB of RAM
* OS is Fast - has been optimized and it shows from the speed of using the device
* Swiping from a movie playing is a total wow moment
* OS is beautiful and a joy to use, integrated accounts are awesome
* Swiping feels natural for Multitasking and closing applications
* Battery is great (at least 1 full day on a charge depending on usage)
* Screen looks amazing, colours and brightness are great.  I keep mine on the lowest brightness setting and I have no problem viewing it at all
* Skype is crystal clear
* Limited application selection but not bad
* Meego open source linux OS
* Drive and Maps are free and do a good job (not quite as fully featured as I would have liked but good)
* PR1.1 update brings a ton of nice features (swype keyboard, performance enhancements and bug fixes)
* Camera is very good and very fast to startup, focus and take pictures!
* Comes with an included silicon case which is nice
* Low Power mode showing clock and notifications is awesome (simple but most other devices do not have this)

Cons
* No US Warranty so be sure to get one from a 3rd party
* Limited application selection if you are expecting android/ios type selection
* Possible first and only meego device though nokia have committed to supporting it through 2015

Make sure you get a screen protector for this one though it appears to be easily scratched even though its gorilla glass.

UPDATE: New Firmware PR1.2 has been released 2 months ago now and things are much better!

To Name a few improvements:
1) Swype keyboard has been improved
2) Camera Improvements
3) Folders in the menus
4) More Apps on the store now, still a lot missing but its not quite as bare anymore - some great applications out there like QNeptunea for Twitter, good community of app builders
5) Drive and Maps have been improved and as always the maps are free which is awesome
+ lots more

I've owned the N9 now for a little over 6 months and I still love the swiping experience, I have tried the lumia 900 and I would take the N9 anyday!  It fits in the hand better as its smaller but at 3.9"" its not too small, the curved glass feels better (900 has hard edges), swiping feels natural and the OS is beautiful no big square chunky blocks on the screen...

You know how sleek the S3 is, and you know how sexy this phone feels, pretty much like sex in the hand.  And if you're anything like me, you may be thinking to yourself ""Self, this phone is SEXY... almost a little TOO sexy.  I can't risk keeping this thing out, unprotected."".  So now you're looking for a sexy case to protect your new baby.  Well, you can stop your research right here.  This case is awesome!

The case comes in two parts, a softer silicon inner skin, and a harder polycarbonate outer shell.  Just slide the phone in the inner skin, then slide the outer shell over the skin, and viola, you've got yourself a well protected phone.  It fits like a glove, and it looks great!  It adds a little bit of thickness to the phone, but not too much.  I would say it adds about 1/8"" thickness around the phone.  For a point of reference, if you've ever owned or held the original Galaxy S, this phone with the case is still slightly thinner than the naked Galaxy S.  The front of the case rises above the screen maybe 1/16"", just enough to protect the screen when it's face down.  Since the inner skin is silicon, it shouldn't affect any screen protector you may install (some hard cases have been known to interfere with the screen protectors causing them to peel away from the screen).  In my opinion, this case gives this phone just enough bulk to make it feel comfortable in my hand.  It's really smooth, but not slippery.  The volume rocker and power buttons are both still accessible, but you may have to push down just slightly harder than normal.

The color of this case is a deeper blue than I was expecting, but I'm pleased with it.  Depending on the lighting and angle that you look at the case, it almost looks purple.  All in all, this case is exactly what I was looking for.  It looks sexy, provides a good amount of protection all around, it allows access to the headphone jack and charger port, and the top and bottom mic's are open as well. I would recommend this case to anyone looking to protect their new S3 while maintaining it's sleek and sexy look!

Ninja Edit (8/9/12):  I have noticed one minor thing about this case, and that is the fact that the silicon edges attract pocket lint.  It wipes off easily, but it's about the only thing I could find wrong with this case and I wanted to mention it in my review.

What I'm looking for in a screen protector is clarity, scratch resistance and excellent tactile feel. Essentially, what the screen feels like without a protector. I've always had good success with the Steinheil Ultra Crystal, but they've said that they won't be producing it for the Rezound so I tried this one.

Clarity:
Very nice. Very little of the fogged over appearance notorious in the screen protectors that Verizon sells at their stores. Blacks are nice and deep. The included spray solutions makes installation easy enough. No bubbles, although a good bit of the ""orange peel effect"" when held at an angle.

Tactile Feel:
Good. Feels very similar to the original glass, with just a little bit more drag.

Scratch resistance:
I'm not sure what Skinomi's strategy was here. It is so soft, that I can put just light pressure with my fingernail and create a permanent dent. It may be that light scratches are less likely to show in a product this soft. Sort of like a self-healing mat used when cutting with an Xacto blade. Already, there are several mars that are particularly apparent while reading a book on the Kindle app. Text appears distorted near the marring, reminding me that I'm not reading a paper book, but a digital screen behind a poor screen protector.

The product, well I'm very happy to say after 3 weeks is working great for me. I followed the battery cycling instructions (I read in several forums that a 12hour charge is best, like you would do a house phone and it gives the EVO a chance to recognize that it's not the stock battery. Not sure how true that is but I just followed the Laza instructions). With that said, the battery door was nice, felt like the stock door and it fit perfectly. The extended battery fit perfect as well. I read some felt the battery was not a snug fit but I had no issues thank God. The case was a plus. I love pink and at first wasn't too happy with the brightness, I'm used to soft pinks or pastels but I love it. Sometimes change is good. The case is not a link attractor either, very durable and makes the EVO more secure in your hand. Now for the real topic, I love my extended battery. I can play Angry Birds a lot longer and listen to music even more now. I can basically multitask a lot more now as well. I was sceptical about the phone being too bulky but it wasn't. I'm pleased to say the bulk isn't so bad, those leary about the bulk, trust me it's not bad, go for it. In my opinion, the draining of the battery solely depends on how much you're doing on/with your phone. I mean really, it's a cell phone running off of a battery not a desk top pc with a wire lol. I must admit, with all that can be done with the EVO battery life should not be an issue. You want the most out of your phone and should be able to multitask or just experiment its full potential without worrying about battery life so yes a more compatible stock battery would've been great but we don't live in a perfect world.

Phones with a tray that slides out take a full-sized sim, phones that you pop it in and out like an SD card take micro SIM.  At least this seems like a proper generalization to me. So as long as you have a tray in the phone you want to work, with a sim that is meant to be inserted into a phone, this adapter is for you, despite if you have an iPhone or not.",works like a charm,1343260800,15.0,,

The main problem is the flimsy and distorted thin bezel section that runs along the bottom edge of the screen below the home button.  This area needs to be reinforced with vertical ""crossbars"" (when viewing bottom elevation) on each side of the Lightning connector so that it doesn't move and is held in place snugly to the bottom of the phone.  Also, there was a general lack of fit of the case despite the tightness during installation.  This lack of fit leads to movement of the case relative to the phone during normal handling, and that guarantees abrasive wear on the phone when any grit or environmental dust gets under the case.  Because of the material used and how thin it is, it is susceptible to slight distortions from the molding process and the bezel that is formed around the screen was not perfectly uniform.  A possible solution could have been to make the bezel a solid element rather than keeping it thin but trying to form it into a semi-circular shape in cross-section.  Speaking of molding, there is a parting seam all around the case where it is noticeable because one's fingertips hold the phone in that area.  On my case, on the bottom of the left edge, it looks like a short section of the seam (perhaps a sprue?) was actually ground down by somebody in quality control.  One more gripe:  In the product photos there is no sign of any branding or logo.  In the delivered product there is a prominent ""MINI[ ]SUIT"" logo in silver on the bottom of the right edge of the case.  Personally, I don't like to display logos or branding, which is why I bought a case, not a bumper, in order to cover the Apple logo, only to be replaced with a Minisuit one.  Gentle scraping of the logo under water removes it easily.  Finally, I would suggest that the matte texture be extended to the entire case or at the very least the bezel surrounding the face of the phone.  The best part of this case IMHO is actually the buttons, although the plus sign symbol seems like an afterthought.  They work well but don't stick out and are less likely to be pressed accidentally.  They are rendered in a matte texture as well.  For now, I'm sticking with my Tech Armor ""frosted black"" TPU case, which is actually grey and quite transparent and the main reason I wanted to try this opaque black Minisuit case.",Had very high expectations but disappointed,1356134400,3.0,,

best features:
- puts the phone into car mode, with outstanding functionality for driving (bigger buttons, only what you need while driving, etc..can get out of car mode if needed.)
- makes google navigation available easily - yes the only part of this the dock does is put the phone into car mode, but the google navigation is absolutely incredible
- car doc itself is very well made and great fit, unlike a generic holder
- combined audio and power cord - this is outstanding - much cleaner looking and very convenient
- cigarette lighter power plug has a second USB outlet
- works with the very inexpensive but decent 'empire' brand case (and probably others too, but not otterbox)- you don't have to take your phone out of the case to use it
- allows excellent positioning of the phone on the dash so you don't have to take your eyes off the road (much safer) vs. using nav by holding the phone in your hand

only part I question is the integrated power plug that goes into the phone - looks like  you need to be careful to insert your phone very straight so as not to either break the plug or you phone .. wasn't any trouble to do, but it's the one possible point of failure on the dock.

it's a little pricey, but I see why they did it this way, (a) b/c of the great quality / features, and (b) I think it's priced to be a profit maker for motorola and they meant it to be compared to the price of a separate GPS unit itself (e.g. spend less than a GPS unit and get a GPS unit, integrated to phone, I think is their thinking, rather than what should a good quality doc cost). but for me, the safety factor together with the added features make this worth it.

NOTE, it's hard to tell from the photo, but the power cord plugs into the back of the doc, and the power plug built into the doc stays there to receive your phone .. so you just slide your phone in, and it's all powered up in one motion - you don't need to insert your phone then plug it in.",love it - outstanding dock and more than just a holder,1338249600,2.0,,

The volume is pretty low when you first put it on, but after turning up the volume it works great. The buttons are easy to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable. It comes with two ear hooks, but not two different sizes. It's strictly a replacement if one gets broken or lost. It also comes with several speaker covers, so that it will fit inside your ear better. It's too bad then that the ear hooks don't come in sizes. Also there are no instructions at all on replacing the hooks nor the covers.

My problem is that it refuses to stay on my ear and rubbed a sore right onto my ear. I tried switching all the speaker covers, but that doesn't have anything to do with the ear hook. Also, because there is no wire in the hook, you cannot bend it to fit your ear properly. That is a definite design flaw. I have tiny ears compared to the average person. This bluetooth assumes that there is a lot of space between the side of my head and the edge of my ear. That is not the case at all with my ears. This is why a curve is important for me, but there is none and no way to make one.

In fact, if you look carefully for a side view of this bluetooth, you'll see that there is no curve whatsoever for the ear hook. It is commonly known that all should have a slant. I guess you get what you pay for. I never had this issue with my higher grade models. The ear hooks were both comfortable and reliable. This one makes my ear bleed and will not stay on. It's not how I put it on, my daughter (who works at Radio Shack) even tried to help me, but without success.

If I could replace the ear hook, then it would be a top-notch bluetooth, but that is impossible so it gets a lower rating. Sorry Samsung!","Great sound, but won't stay on the ear and is uncomfortable.",1286150400,2.0,,

It seems as though it was made in a rush due to the iPhone 5's coming out so suddenly because the dark purple rubber does not fit the phone and doesn't mold to it very well at all. It's stretched out and almost doesn't stay on the upper sides of the phone. The flap that covers the headphone jack and the lightening cable port are so poorly designed. They barely stay shut when I first put it on so I assume the more I use those flaps the more loose they'll become and eventually won't close at all. The sleep/wake button is difficult to press but not as hard as the last case that I tried by another brand and returned to Amazon. This is so frustrating to me because obviously that's a button that is pressed very often and they makes it VERY annoying. The volume buttons however are not terrible. They're alright to press through the case - slightly hard. Overall a DECENT case. The color and protection is on point, unfortunately the design and molding to the phone are very disappointing. I have yet to find a case that I love and that offers great protection. I don't think this case is bulky by any means. If you're looking for protection, it's a good thickness.

5.0,True,2012-09-03,A38CHSS1ZAE51B,B0060N5F38,,Handy,"Ok before I get started I just want to say that the phone is great and so far it makes a great paper weight. (UPDATE Now working with Net10 perfectly) I have had plenty of time to fiddle with all the settings and because of WiFi I have been able to update all my apps and make the phone the way I like it.

Also if you have not read any of the reviews and your used to the un-touched Android system you should know that AT&T added and changed some of the things in the Pantech like the bottom four soft key buttons can't be changed (call,mess,net,etc).  I found a way around this using (Go Launcher Pro) from Google play.  It is a free desktop skin for Android and it overrides the AT&T screen and has a bunch of great themes you can add to it, very sweet.  Also their call program is a bit different, but in the end I ended up liking it better than the original as it was easier to navigate and the colors are easy on the eyes. (UPDATE ON THE CALL PROGRAM) I found that I could not use the AT&T contact list as it would just hang waiting to talk to AT&T servers.  Since I was not going to use this phone with AT&T I found another great freebee on Google play called ""EX DIALER""  Not only did it by pass the AT&T program so that I could use my contacts updated from my Google account, it also has some great skins to make it cool looking.

It still takes me a little bit to get used to having the settings and home buttons as ""hard"" buttons instead of ""soft touch"" buttons but it's not that big of a deal.  I heard of some folks talk about the screen being hard to see or have a yellow tint but my phone shows none of those problems and the screen can be set to be very bright.  It does not have an auto brightness built in like my Droid.  I bought a nice rubberized case for it that fit it perfectly and ordered some screen covers to boot.

The camera for me takes pretty good pictures even in lower light but one draw back it that it has about a 2 second delay from when you hit the camera button and when it clicks the pic.  You almost think it isn't going to take the picture so if your trying to get that quick before it's gone pic you might be disappointed, but I didn't need a super camera so it does just fine for me.

The outside speaker on this phone is very quiet compared to my Droid.  I could hardly hear the ringer even if it was in my hand and I found myself wanting to keep turning it up.  So to fix this I found another app on Google play called (Funny SMS Ringtones) and it has some great ""LOUD & Funny"" sounds for notification and ringtones that are easy to hear.  I think that it's not so much the speakers fault but that the built in ringtones are just to quiet.  So now when my phone rings (testing it) it is very loud.  (UPDATE)  After using this phone in the real world with the new ringtones I have no problem hearing my phone even in it's case.

Now the real reason I bought this phone over many others was because of the keyboard.  Most keyboards are too small for my big (meat cutter fingers) to use.  But Pantech decided to use four rows instead of 5 so that you can actually get your fingers on the darn buttons.  Some complain about that and others say it's great.  (UPDATE) I did notice that when using the screen keyboard that it does not have a T9 or any other suggestion program like my Droid had but since I use the keyboard most of the time anyway it does not matter to me except when I can't spell something right : ) Other than that it does what most Android smart phones do and I really like the phone and it's ""different"" design and should be happy with it for some time.

So Now the ugly...  If you are thinking of buying this phone and using it with AT&T just don't do it.  You will regret it and will be very upset for spending your hard earned dollars.  If you want a taste of how bad things are with AT&T just Google ([...] ) and read all the reviews.
I myself bought this phone to use with Net10 and I'm just waiting for the Sim card and Minutes to arrive in the mail.  But I was hoping to use the $25 air time to hold me until my stuff came from Net10.  Well After several frustrating talks with Amazon that kept trying to get me to the Amazon wireless (who by the way has nothing to do with prepaid phones) I finally got to talk to someone who took the time to forward me to AT&T and wait on the line until I got to talk to a real human (Almost impossible to do with AT&T).

After talking to the AT&T rep I found out that it could take up to 10 days to activate my phone.  I said WHAT???  Ten days, are you kidding me.  He said yes.  I told him that there isn't another phone company anywhere that would make me wait 10 days to turn on a phone.  He informed me that there was nothing he could do as it was already in the system. In the mean time my phone keeps getting texts (every day) from AT&T telling me I need to give them more money.  And I asked him about that.  He said my information was in the system and it ""should"" activate.  But yet the stupid system keeps telling me to give more money (even today).  It does not say anything about my phone waiting to activate.  They have very deceptive practices and very lousy customer support from India.
The other thing they don't tell you is that even if you buy a $50 ""unlimited"" card you still have to pay for a ""data"" plan for this phone.  The ""unlimited"" plan does not include your data (and you have to have a data plan for this phone).  So in the end you will end up paying the $50.00 and up to $15.00 for a data plan.  For a better price you can use this phone with a company like Straight Talk or Net10 for $50 bucks or under and it covers everything.  So save yourself the trouble and don't use AT&T.  It has been over 6 days now (Update 9 days) and still I get the ""give us money texts"" and no service from them.  Even though they say everything is right and I did set it up correctly.  I did finally get Amazon to give my $25 bucks back and that helped with all the trouble.

So in the end after spending months looking for a good smart phone from some of the pre-paid company's and being very disappointed with the quality as most were very cheap this phone feels great and the keyboard is supper easy to use and has a nice feel to it (Especially with the new Rubberized Case).  I would not have a problem paying the full price for it.  Though I just saw that it went up almost 40 bucks (UPDATE) Looks like they dropped it back down.  Still when looking for a great quality though not the fanciest smart phone this phone is very much worth the price.  Just don't think you will get that $25 bucks from AT&T because you will be sadly mistaken.  I have talked to Amazon about this as I'm sure others have too but it seems that because it is sold with the credit it is not something they can change so make a informed decision and get a good phone and ignore the $25 dollar air time credit.

UPDATE 9-10-12  Ok so after 9 days I still had no service from AT&T and my Net10 sim and air time card finally arrived.  So I called up Net10 to make sure I did everything right.  Took about 5 minutes to ad my information and Activate the Sim.  Told me to turn off the phone and turn it back on.  So I did and like a normal phone service should act my phone was activated and running IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES.

After that I had to update the Access Point Name on my Pantech to work with Net10 data servers (Internet and Email) and I was done.  They give you pretty easy instructions on the settings that need to be updated but I still had to go online to see where I could find these settings on my phone.

For those of you that are not intimidated by this, this is how you do that.  On your home screen hit the settings button (left hard button) and touch the settings tab.  Then touch the (wireless & networks) button.  Then scroll down to the bottom and touch the (Mobile Networks) button.  The you will see the third listing down is (Access Point Names) so touch that button.  When you get to this point you will see the two AT&T settings.  So now just click on the left hard button to bring up the settings and touch the (New APN) button.  From this point you will need the settings that come with your service provider.  Just fill in the ones it tells you and leave the others blank.  Make sure to take your time and get all the spelling right or you will have to do it again.  After that  just hit the back button and then you will see the new APN (Net10, Straight Talk).  Just touch the button next to the name to highlight it green and then click your home button and that's it.

I do thank someone for telling me about going to Facebook to fix the AT&T problem but if that is the way a company works where I can't talk to someone live on the phone and fix the problem then I do not want to do business with them.  I know for a fact that there is no way to prove who you are on Facebook and you could be talking to anybody in the world.  There are millions of fake Facebook accounts.  If you gave that person your information and then found out it was fake you would be in serious trouble.  It's just not the way to do business.

One more thing that I thought I would mention is about the Google sign in when you first boot up the phone.  If you have ever had a android phone before and had a Google account then this is the account you want to use when it asks.  If you don't have one then you will at this point want to go online and make one as you will need it to get on the Google play for all your Apps.  Even if you have not activated the phone you want to enter this information the first time you turn on your phone because if you don't do it now there is a chance that it will never sync your accounts (Email and Personals like Phone #'s).  And then the only way to fix it is to factory reset the phone and start over.  Just ask me how I found this one out lol....

So in the end what is my view on this phone?  I really like this phone and if it had been my first Android phone I probably wouldn't have known the difference.  I think in the end it would have been better for AT&T to leave the phone alone and let the customer decide what programs they wanted or at least make it possible to remove them.  But thankfully by using a couple of add on's like Go launcher Pro, EX Dialer & Funny SMS Ringtones it made my phone work like a charm.  I also understand that this is not a high end phone but in the end it was WAY BETTER than the stock phones I saw in the stores for $100 bucks or more and I am very pleased with it.  So if your going to use AT&T (not my suggestion) then you probably would be able to use this thing right out of the box (once they finally get your phone turned on).  But if your going to use it with another company then I would download the few add on's and make sure your Google account is entered as soon as you first turn on your phone and you should be pretty happy with it.  I know I am so thanks for taking the time to read my very long review and good luck : )

UPDATE 9-9-13:  Well if you made it this far on my super long review then you will be super glad to know that after a year I have had not one problem with this phone.  It's still going strong with no key problems or any other problems.  Really this is one of the best phones I have ever had.  Now I have a friend that uses Verizon and has gone through more phones than I have underwear (no kidding).  Every time he tells me he had to get another phone because of this or that I just laugh and shake my head and thank God that after a year I am still going strong with this little phone.  The only thing I have had to buy is another case as I finally dropped the phone and it broke.

+ Provides good protection
+ Reasonably easy to install (bubbles work themselves out)
+ Good visibility (some shields blur screen)
+ Included spray, squeegee and cloth

Cons:
- Sticky (friction-wise), non-smooth surface makes it difficult to perform smooth finger swipes. Finger gets stuck or stutters from time to time. This alone brings down the rating quite a bit.
- Price is about as high as they get (although not unreasonable)

It actually fits the HD screen you see on modern TVs when held horizontally. This means more scrolling when reading horizontally and a smaller onscreen keyboard when swype-ing, so it gave me pause when ordering. Having used it for six months, I can say that I've gotten used to these challenges, even though I do have big fingers and I especially enjoy the form factor.

Bottom line is that a phone fits in your hand, and this one fits better than others with large screeens. It is also very thin with rounded edges. Even with a form-fitting cover (see separate review) it fits in my pocket and my hand so much better than the other options. As you know, I carry it every day, so this really matters more than the hypothetical loss of screen real estate.

Phone calls are clear, reception is excellent, and wifi works great (I usually don't have a data plan, since when I'm away from buildings I generally only want to do phone calls, read books, or look up information in my databases.

My go to app is google mail, calendar, and contacts, all of which are syncing fine between my computer and phone.

For reading, I have used kindle for android, adobe reader, and Olive Tree Bible Study app. I am satisfied with all of them. I also occasionally use the built in software to access MS office files (through dropbox) and it has worked fine.

I have used the phone to watch you tube videos, but I don't really see a phone as a TV.

I do use the camera quite a bit. While the optics are a step down from the larger lens on my Nikon P60, I always have it with me and the resolution is adequate for screen viewing, but not for extensive enlargements. E.g., it's better for memories than for publication.

I am totally pleased with this phone. It is plenty fast enough for my mobile apps and it has already served me well for six months. I hope you can get a good deal on one yourself.

Technical note: it does take the smaller sim cards. It also has 16 gb storage, but no removable sd card or battery. I have not found this a problem though it was something I considered at the time of purchase, and as you can see, I greatly appreciate the form factor, which benefits from these space saving measures.

OCT. 19, 2010 UPDATE:
The TwitterPeek does NOT work any longer. Don't buy it. If you already have a TwitterPeek with LIFETIME SERVICE, this is NOW what PEEK INC. is telling me: PEEK INC. is only offering TwitterPeek Users with LIFETIME SERVICE to switch to a Peek 9 with only ONE YEAR OF SERVICE. No more LIFETIME SERVICE on a direct straight swap. But someone else in the GetPeek discussion forum is saying you have to pay an extra $50 to get lifetime service on the Peek 9 if you want to swap to a Peek 9. It's up to you. But I say: Don't buy the TwitterPeek. Get a real phone with internet on the phone for doing your twitter. Based on my experience with the TwitterPeek, you can expect a DEAD DEVICE and you will be wasting your money.

*******
OCT. 14, 2010 UPDATE:
The TwitterPeek no longer works. The TwitterPeek is a dead device. According to a support message that I've received, PEEK INC has no ETA as to when twitter service may be restored. PEEK INC. is now saying that TwitterPeek users should get the Peek 9 device which is their new email device. There's is a ""lemonade"" offer where you can get a Peek 9 for $1, but you have to contact PEEK to swap your lifetime service from the TwitterPeek to the Peek 9. But there is NO TWITTER on the Peek 9 because PEEK INC. still hasn't gotten twitter to work. They may advertise twitter on the Peek 9, but they admit twitter is not working. I haven't switched to the Peek 9 yet, but anticipate doing so to at least get some sort of LIFETIME SERVICE that I've originally paid for. [EDIT: my contact at support is checking to see if there is a difference in paying for the Lifetime Service on the PEEK9. If there is, I may not want to get it because I've paid all that I want to pay for these Peek devices.]

If you are looking at the TwitterPeek, don't get it. Additionally, I suggest you don't bother looking at any of Peek's other devices because the service is not reliable from my experience and also if you look at the GetPeek discussion forums where people complain about the outages on the other Peek devices. You will be better off looking for an unlocked phone, put an AT&T SIM card on the phone, and use AT&T GoPhone prepaid service on the phone to get voice as well as internet to thereby get twitter.  As I've mentioned in a previous update, my review here used to be five stars, but I've since downgraded my review to ONE STAR. Don't get the TwitterPeek. I used to be enthusiastic for the TwitterPeek, but I now wholeheartedly agree with the other one-star reviews here. Those other one-star reviews had no experience with the TwitterPeek, but I have experience with the TwitterPeek and can tell you that you will definitely make a mistake if you get the TwitterPeek since the TwitterPeek is now a dead do-nothing bricked device and when the company behind the device is telling people to switch to something else.

SEPT. 29, 2010 UPDATE:

From the PEEK discussion forum (@amolsarva):

TwitterPeek fix status :

Official word on TwitterPeek:
- while we were getting ready to launch Peek 9
- Twitter changed a bunch of stuff
- that broke TwitterPeek
- but we are nearly through fixing it up
- and it's going to work not only on all TwitterPeeks
- but also on Peek 9s
- and you can even turn it on Peek Prontos [...]

If you want a credit back for a ""monthly plan"" TwitterPeek please email care@getpeek

A cool thing is that the links are ""followable"" by the mini browser. That will work on all Peeks

SEPT. 18, 2010 UPDATE:

Because of a recent change in how Twitter authenticates accounts, the TwitterPeek has been DEAD in getting service from Twitter since about the beginning of September 2010. First, the people at PEEK Inc. said that they would have access to Twitter restored by Thursday, September 16, but that date fell through. Now, they say they will have access to Twitter restored by sometime the following week (which is next week after the time when I'm currently writing this update) in time for the debut of their next product called the Peek 9. So far I've got only three months out of the lifetime service for my TwitterPeek. And I'm waiting to see if this comatose TwitterPeek actually rises from the dead and starts working again. Totally annoying having to wait to see if that actually happens. I'll report back if and when Twitter access is restored on the TwitterPeek, or if there is some other change, BUT I have to agree with the naysayers, that you will be better off with a smartphone that has some type of internet access for accessing Twitter while you are on the go away from a computer. For instance, look at the unlocked phones that can take GSM cards like the LG phones or even the iphone clones that you can use with AT&T GoPhone prepaid service for voice calls and internet.

ORIGINAL (AND NOW *WORTHLESS*) June 23, 2010 REVIEW
WITH THE JULY 11, 2010 UPDATE....
GOOD CONCEPT BUT NOW DEAD WORTHLESS DEVICE....
DON'T BUY ANY OF THE PEEK DEVICES....
DON'T EVEN BUY THEIR SO-CALLED NEW PEEK 9....
PEEK IS A RIP-OFF. STAY VERY FAR AWAY FROM PEEK....
======================================

TwitterPeek is either something you want or it is something you really despise. There seems to be no other than two ways about it. You either like it or hate it.

For the record, I do like the TwitterPeek. However, the TwitterPeek is not for everyone. Particularly, not for those who just don't understand Twitter and certainly not for those vocal Haters who can't understand the reason for a single-purpose device like the TwitterPeek when there are the more multi-purpose smartphones like the iPhone. People definitely do want to have their smartphones and all the more power to them. And then there are those people who will want the TwitterPeek for it's single-purpose simplicity and the lack of a monthly phone bill if you get the TwitterPeek with ""lifetime"" service. It's a choice that the beauty and the diversity of the marketplace provides because people will buy what they want.

Okay, let's compare the two sides of those who want the TwitterPeek and those who hate the Twitterpeek.

First, this is what is typically said by those who sadly really hate and despise the TwitterPeek with a vengeance in blogs and comments around the web:

1. TwitterPeek is nothing but a piece of @#$!&* junk.
2. Twitter is a complete waste of time.
3. Isn't Twitter just like TXTing which you can do with your cell phone anyways?
4. TwitterPeek is a complete waste of money.
5. Two Hundred Dollars can be used to buy a real smartphone.
6. Get a REAL smartphone like the iPhone, Droid, Blackberry, etc.
7. TwitterPeek is another device that you have to carry.
8. The TwitterPeek interface is horrible using that Scroll Wheel.
9. Using the Scroll Wheel to go into and out of tweets is like doing email.
10. TwitterPeek doesn't show complete tweets in the timeline.
11. TwitterPeek can't do the new Twitter Lists.
12. TwitterPeek can't do multiple accounts.
13. The company behind the TwitterPeek is doomed to go out of business.
14. Real Geeks hate the TwitterPeek and you should too.
15. Only idiots would want to use a TwitterPeek.

Now, let's go on to those who happily and definitely want the TwitterPeek:

1. TwitterPeek with lifetime service is now approximately one hundred bucks on Amazon.
2. TwitterPeek with lifetime service means no monthly bills.
3. TwitterPeek with no monthly bills goes perfect with a cheap or prepaid cell phone.
4. TwitterPeek is for people who don't want a smartphone.
5. Use TwitterPeek's keyboard to quickly go through tweets instead of using the Scroll Wheel.
6. Use the N and P keys to go quickly from tweet to tweet. It's not that bad.
7. You don't have to be a Geek to use a TwitterPeek.
8. The company behind TwitterPeek shouldn't go out of business.
9. People who use the TwitterPeek are not idiots. Don't Rain On Our Parade.
10. REPEAT: TwitterPeek with lifetime service is now approximately one hundred bucks on Amazon.

The battle between the LOVE-HATE adversarial opinions about the TwitterPeek is kind of ridiculous. It's like talking about religion where the people who hate the TwitterPeek really hate the TwitterPeek with a vengeance as an automatic reflex action on their part. The one area of contention that I find to be very silly is the criticism about the navigation using the Scroll Wheel. Yes, it's BAD going in and out of tweets using the Scroll Wheel and the back button. But the better way to really quickly go through your tweets on the TwitterPeek is to use keyboard commands. Click the Enter (Return) key on a selected tweet and then use the ""N"" key (for Next) and the ""P"" key (for Previous) to go from tweet to tweet (yes, one at a time) to very quickly and seamlessly go through your twitter timeline. This has the same practical effect of what you're doing anyways if you are reading one-tweet-at-a-time whether in a timeline or not. But the die-hard twitter aficionados and critics will say that you can't scan complete tweets in the whole timeline at once. Nonetheless, if you are quickly going through tweets using keyboard commands with the ""N"" and ""P"" keys, then that shouldn't make too much of a difference when you are looking at a very small screen. The video included with this review is intended to give you an idea as to how to navigate the Twitter timeline either using the scroll-wheel or the keyboard on the TwitterPeek.

The storage space on the TwitterPeek is approximately only 7.5 megabytes. That's like teeny weeny tiny in size. That's megabytes. Not gigabytes. But we're talking about Twitter text messages that are only 140 characters long per tweet. So that's more than enough storage space. To me, this does make the TwitterPeek seem like an overly expensive device at its original price of two hundred dollars when it is such a tiny single-purpose twitter-only device. But whether at the original two-hundred dollar price tag or at the recently discounted price of approximately one-hundred bucks, whatever you're paying for the TwitterPeek with lifetime service, then that should go mostly towards the service. It's like you're prepaying mostly for the ""lifetime"" service and getting the TwitterPeek device for some lesser amount. And when you then average out what you've paid upfront over time, then that may turn out to be a good deal if all you want to do is twitter and assuming you don't lose or break the TwitterPeek device because the ""lifetime"" service is for the ""lifetime"" of the device that you are buying. You just have to assume and hope that the company behind the TwitterPeek (and its older sibling the Peek Pronto) stays in business to continue providing you with the online service that is suppose to send tweets to your TwitterPeek.

On a related note, regarding the online service, from what I could tell, the TwitterPeek retrieves tweets every 5-to-15 minutes. (I've noticed similar delays from some, but perhaps not all, people who do Twitter and send tweets from their smartphones.) Usually, this is okay because tweets would be coming in all the time like this. But sometimes it may look like the TwitterPeek has stopped receiving tweets. If it looks like the TwitterPeek has stopped receiving tweets, like if an hour has gone by and you don't see any new tweets, try turning the TwitterPeek off and then on.  This assumes you expect to get a bunch of tweets every few minutes or so from a lot of people whom you follow. Currently, I follow over 300+ people and there will be someone or someone else (although NOT everyone at the same time all the time) tweeting something every few minutes whether during the day or at night (which could be their day if they are elsewhere in the world). So I expect to constantly be getting tweets that are waiting for me to look at in a timeline pile of tweets. (If you follow only a few people, then your frequency of receiving tweets may be less and not as often.)  Then if it looks like the tweets have stopped for a long time, then the chances are the TwitterPeek may need to be rebooted.  Turn the TwitterPeek off and then on to see if those missing tweets show up.  If the TwitterPeek is really not getting any new tweets, then that could be for any variety of reasons like the main Twitter servers (that everyone accesses) are overwhelmed or down during very busy times like during the recent World Cup soccer games or if Twitter is having other technical problems. I've seen that happen with the regular Twitter website and with other third-party Twitter apps (like Tweetie or Hootsuite). Reboot your TwitterPeek (turn it off and then turn it back on) to see if that clears things up on your end. Or wait to see if Twitter clears up and starts updating again.

Okay, there are some other things to be aware of if you really want to get this TwitterPeek device. You can click the link in a tweet, but you'll only get the text for the webpage that the link is for. Sometimes, you may have to scroll through a bunch of text to get the main part of page that you want to read. If the linked page is too complex or if it is busy, you may get nothing. You can get pictures with the TwitterPeek but only if the links are at Twitpic (most of the time) and not anywhere else. The TwitterPeek does not do email. It only does Twitter. No multiple accounts. The battery life is suppose to last four days, but that depends on how much you use it and whether you have a good or bad signal. Maybe expect to plug it in to charge every night and be happy if you only have to charge the TwitterPeek every two days or more. It does come with a charger to plug into an electrical wall outlet. However, if you want to charge the TwitterPeek via the USB on your computer, then you'll have to get a blackberry cable to hook up the TwitterPeek to your computer to charge the TwitterPeek's battery. Don't expect firmware updates for the TwitterPeek. The folks at Peek Inc. think that the TwitterPeek works fine for the basic twitter functionality that it provides.

The TwitterPeek cannot directly handle tweets that contain foreign language characters like japanese, chinese, korean, and thai. Yet, I've noticed that japanese, chinese, korean, and, recently, thai characters in tweets are converted into romanized text. I'm guessing that a romanization conversion happens at the Peek servers before the tweets are sent to the TwitterPeek.  It's not a translation, but a romanization of those script characters into text for phonetic pronunciation purposes. However, there may be some question marks or different strange characters where the conversion is not complete. I don't know about any other script languages. Also related to this, it looks like the TwitterPeek unfortunately cannot handle some symbol characters like the heart symbol or a pointing hand/finger symbol or musical note symbols that people may use in tweets -- you'll get question marks instead. (NOTE TO THE PEOPLE AT PEEK: It would be visually more pleasing if any incomplete conversion be replaced by asterisks instead of question marks.)

There are other PROs and CONs for the TwitterPeek. You can read the other reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere to find out what other people say about the TwitterPeek.

As previously mentioned, YES, I do like the TwitterPeek. I find it easy to use where I primarily use keyboard commands. I've waited for Amazon to drop the price for the TwitterPeek (with ""lifetime"" service) before buying it. So far, I've been keeping my TwitterPeek turned on pretty much all the time -- but every once in while I would turn-it-off-and-on to reboot the TwitterPeek if it looks like it ""stopped"" receiving tweets.  What I typically do is I use the TwitterPeek when I'm away from my computer -- and then when I am using my macbook then I may have the TwitterPeek plugged into the USB on the computer with a blackberry cable (a kindle cable works also) to charge the TwitterPeek's battery, and I would be accessing Twitter mostly on the computer -- and later, in a kind of tag-team hand off, when I'm away from the computer, then I would be using the TwitterPeek.

However, is the TwitterPeek for you? If you really want an iPhone or some other smartphone, then this is certainly not for you. If you are not into Twitter, or if you don't understand all the hoopla surrounding Twitter, then this is particularly not for you. However, if you don't want a smartphone (like an iPhone), particularly if you don't want the monthly bill that comes with a smartphone, and if you want on-the-go twitter access, then the TwitterPeek (with ""lifetime"" service) may possibly be for you.

Thank you for reading and viewing this review.

P.S. UPDATE July 11, 2010:

As another point of comparison for navigating the TwitterPeek, I was looking at youtube video demonstration reviews for the AT&T Social Net app for the AT&T smartphones because I was looking at the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AT-T-LG-Prime-Prepaid-GoPhone/dp/B003SNJ8X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AT&T LG Prime Prepaid GoPhone</a>&nbsp;which is something like an iPhone. The AT&T Social Net application let's you access Twitter, Facebook, Myspace, etc. and the way that you navigate the app reminds me of the TwitterPeek where the main timeline has truncated tweets that are cut off at the end of each tweet and if you want to read the whole tweet then you have to go into each individual tweet. And the fast way to go through tweets is navigating message by message. So the TwitterPeek navigation is not really new and similar navigation although in a different interface can be found on other devices.

Also, it looks like the price for the TwitterPeek is closing in on the ninety dollar mark for the ""charcoal"" version of the TwitterPeek. The price for the ""aqua"" version is under one hundred fifty at this time. I would really like to eventually get the ""aqua"" version. Nice. Whichever one you get, assuming you're getting the TwitterPeek with ""lifetime"" service, you can consider whatever amount that you're paying to be like mostly for your prepaid ""lifetime"" service on the device.

Anyways, the TwitterPeek is a good buy as far as I'm concerned and I've been happy with mine. And to be clear, I do *NOT* work for PEEK INC. I'm only a user of the TwitterPeek device. However, at this point, one thing that frustrates me about the TwitterPeek (and I think this may also frustrate people using the Peek Pronto which is the email version of the device that is also made by the same PEEK INC. company that makes the TwitterPeek) is the recent service outage that have occurred. One occurred on the July 4th weekend on two consecutive days and lasted several hours each day. I'm guessing that those outages were related to how the Peek Inc. company was expanding in Europe and had to get their servers working to also serve new European users of the Peek Pronto devices in multiple countries. However, I guess that I have to expect these hiccups that may happen as part of the growing pains that the PEEK INC. company may be going through as they expand worldwide. Otherwise, I've been happy with my TwitterPeek. Here's hoping for continued smooth sailing with minimal if any hiccups.",TwitterPeek No Longer Works - Peek has become a Rip-Off - (old title: TwitterPeek is either for You or not for You),1277251200,7.0,,

I installed it using a suction cup on the windshield about 2 weeks ago and despite the car being parked and driven under tropical sun, it still hasn't fallen off ! It really SUCKS (the only time when that's a good thing !)
It comes with 2 cradles- iPhone-specific and one generic for use with any GPS, phone, etc
Regrettably, the iPhone cradle can only be used without any skin/case on the iPhone (even the thinnest Incipio Feather case I'm using is too big to fit in the cradle). Removing the case from iPhone and putting it back every time I enter/leave the car seems rather impractical and will surely scratch up the iPhone, so might as well not use the case in the first place.
Instead, I'm using the generic cradle for the iPhone which works well, has a good grip and is easy to get the phone in and out. But (and here's a big BUT), the two supporting brackets on the bottom of the cradle prevent the charging cable to be used with the iPhone ! The workaround would be to fold these two brackets (i.e. not use them) and just handle the phone carefully when removing from the cradle (not to let it slip and fall).
Still, this is probably the best quality car holder available.

The only thing I don't care for (but isn't a deal breaker) is the phone tends to wobble from left to right due to the USB port being raised to allow for the optional plate for those without cases.  The phone doesn't really wobble on its own, only when you touch/move the phone.  I understand the reason behind it and can't expect them to make different models of the dock for different phone configurations when they can just make one dock and just use removable plates to suit everyone's needs.

I would love to see Seidio come out with this same dock with both a USB port and HDMI connection.  That would be great considering the stock HTC/Sprint one doesn't ""play nice"" with cases.  It's really too bad too, considering all we are trying to do is protect our investment (phone) from damage by using a case.

What drew me to it was that it was similar to my personal bluetooth headset, the classic voyager 510, and would sit in my ear instead of near my ear like the CS55.  The CS55 wasn't the most comfortable or stable on my ear but it worked and I never had any connection issues; battery life was also really good.

The CS70 disappoints in several areas.  First, feedback and connection issues.  Half of the time when I am talking I hear myself in the ear piece. I have tried every combination of volumes, channels, and distances between myself, the receiver and the phone with no luck.  Second, battery life should be more for an office phone.  I can't get much more than 2.5-3 hours of talk time out of it.  If someone has one of these for work then it's because they use it a lot and can only charge it for 5-10 minutes between calls or over lunch.  My voyager 510 (which I assume has the same batteries since the ear piece it almost identical) will talk for 5+ hours and I never had an issue with the CS55.  Last, the receiver/charging base.  It's a common complaint that the headset just pops off of the charging connection in the base.  I knew this and figured it was because most people aren't careful.  Well, you have to be very careful when removing and replacing the headset so as to get it to charge and not pop.  I would say that I have this issue 10% of the time, but I think that is still way to often for how careful I am.  There are still times where I return in the morning to find it off the charging connection when it was fine the previous evening.

Kinda related, but I'd like to say a bit about the lifter unit. I had one at my previous job and figured I'd get one again.  While I still find it helpful, I've found two things about it that will dissuade me from getting it next time.  First, the lifter that I have this time is SUPER powerful; it drops the phone down hard and I think it's too loud for an office setting.  The lifter that I had at my previous job was not so disruptive.  Yes, I got both of the two units new, so I have to assume that there is just some serious variation in the stepper motors.  Second, I installed the lifter immediately upon setting up my whole headset stuff and that lifter is not coming off of the phone without serious damage.  This means that I would have had a hard time trying to return this CS70N, which I really wanted to do.  This made me realize how little I actually need the lifter if the above to reasons have dissuaded me from buying it in the future. Just my two cents.

In the end, this headset gets the job done and is much better than having to use the handset, but I think the CS55 works better as an office phone and the lifter isn't that great of an accessory, at least for me.","It works, but not their best",1294358400,10.0,,

I have the Griffin, AluPen, and this one that I ordered all from Amazon. They all work flawlessly. However, they are similarities between these styluses. I think most of the iPad stylus competitors, except for Ten One Design with there foam (or sponge) stuffed styluses, have went straight for the rubber (not innuendoly speaking). This approach is actually quite impressive. They all conduct perfectly. The Griffin and other styluses alike, have the really good styluses. However, there tip can be exposed to dirt and possible damage from being in the pocket and other sharp objects and can be worn out quite easily if exposed like that. Now here's an approach that I applaud Hard Candy Cases for. You get a cap to cover the tip, keeping it nicely protected. I didn't even consider an actually pen on the other end so that's a plus. The design is sleek, but in a way, not that impressive. It feels nice in my hand when I draw on my 4th gen iPod touch, but the overall design may be somewhat inconvenient. The implementation of a clip on the stylus would be nice for pockets and so it wouldn't roll on the table. And another thing about the design is, in my opinion, that the stylus when both caps are on would look like something that would be found in a lady's night stand, if you get what I mean. I really want to rate this five stars. I was wanting to give three and a half stars, but since I couldn't do that, I gave it four. In my opinion, this isn't worth $35. They could at least drop the shipping or the price a bit, so I didn't have to pay $41 bucks for this. I was also expecting a more of an aqua color, but I guess the florescent in the picture brought that out somewhat. More colors would be nice like blue, green, purple, red, and pink. I wouldn't recommend this stylus if it weren't for the cap for the tip. The AluPen (I got the blue one), comes in several different colors. It feels like a chunky pencil like in grammer school, but it's really accurate and is accurate as this stylus. Plus, it has it's own cover to protect not only the tip, but the whole stylus.

I also frequently drop my phone and the battery and cover go flying.  This should prevent that from happening and should extend the life of my TB dramatically.

However, I just realized that they also make a 1 piece cover called SURFACE (it does not seem to be listed on amazon).

This cover is two separate pieces.  A silicone inner cover (the ""skin"") and a harder shell with 6 arms (the ""skeleton"") that wrap around the inner cover at the corners and two at the sides.  There is a kickstand in the skeleton that you used instead of the kickstand built into the TB.

The very nice thing about this kickstand, is that it can support the phone from either side, which enables charging while you are watching a movie... very cool.

I also like using the stand to hold my iPhone by the bed when running my alarm clock app.  The narrower profile of the iPhone 4 means a wide variety of cases should be compatible with the non-adjustable stand.

The one thing I didn't like about the Elago M2 Mobile Stand and why I knocked a star off is that there was nothing provided to protect a naked iPhone from scraping against the aluminum.

I use a cell for talking and texting 50/50, with an occasional use for random picture taking. For example, in the past two years, I have recently switched from my old reliable samsung sgh-x497 flip to a razr, now looking again since I gave my samsung to my mom, and the razr I bought on craigs started acting up (button not working). Anyway, on to the short 'review'. Keep in mind, I only used it a week.

PROS
-feels well-built, solid, metallic
-FM radio works well, easy to use
-gives 'conversation view' for texts, if you like that
-good speaker volume for conversations and radio, but low volume during calling someone
-picture quality average

CONS
-phone slows down while texting, and especially gets troublesome during text conversations with multiple parties. For instance, if u are in the process of typing a text and you get another one, it interrupts you and you have to stop and answer with 'reply' or 'ignore'. I think they should have omitted this. Then if you press 'reply' it auto-saves your message you were typing to drafts. Also, even though it displays the conv thread, you still have to actually click on each message, even tho you can read the whole thing-if you don't, the phone still shows you that you have unread msgs. Annoying.
-call quality was just ok
-touchscreen sometimes became unresponsive(I also figured out I don't like touchscreens at all)
-I didn't like the UI at times, for instance, it has a 'tap-n-drag' type contacts button, which is nice, but you better be careful, because you can easily call the wrong person unless you have (accurate) surgeons hands
-many misstypings, even after calibrating touchscreen

After reading numerous complaints from Note users on AT&T, it seems they are receiving texts from AT&T saying they need a tablet data plan.  If ignored, AT&T simply shuts down the data, rendering the phone useless.

Is this even legal?  I am nervous about putting my SIM in this thing when it arrives since I have grandfathered unlimited data.  If AT&T plays games and tries to cancel my plan, claiming this large phone is a tablet (which it is NOT a tablet) I will be supremely pissed.

So, AT&T users in the US.  When did you put your SIM in for the first time and how long have you used it without threats from AT&T?  Those who did get a threat, how long did it take?

*** 12/20 edit ***

In an effort to fiend off the angry mob of negative voters, I'd thought I would add to my review.  Received my Note yesterday, rooted it, backed up and deleted the EFS folder, set the APN settings and all seems to be well.  Working fine and it's an amazing device.  I do still, worry that AT&T will hunt me down with the accusatory text saying I'm using a tablet not a smartphone.

So, for now, I plan on keeping this for a long time as it's an incredible device.  If AT&T acts up, I'll return it and get something else.  So, if you are on the fence and have AT&T in the US, don't just plop you SIM in and go unless you want to open a debate with the carrier about a tablet vs. phone argument.

*** Additional Edit ***

Keep down rating me all you want, but I have a gift for you all.  I personally worked with product managers at AT&T and they realized the Note's IMEI's were incorrectly classified as tablets.  Because of my working with them, an issue was identified and corrected with the Note's IMEI and now they are recognized in AT&T's system as a smartphone.

Since links are deleted, go to XDA-developers dot com, forums, Galaxy Note, Q&A forum and see the thread titled ""AT&T users of Galaxy Note - I was able to remedy the tablet issue!!!""

I schlep around the Blackberry and the Charge together on the same belt in Otterbox cases.  So this is where I'm coming from.

This case is large, as someone else has written.  And no duh on that.  The damned phone is huge, so the case will make it that much bigger.  Deal with it!

The Otterbox case fits very well onto the Charge, and the quality of the plastic and neoprene castings is excellent.  The clear plastic screen protector is integral to the plastic front cover of the case and it has no negative impact upon the functionality of the Charge's touch screen.  The belt-clip holster for the case is of the snap-in variety, not a true holster like on the 8350i or Centro.  For the uninitiated, what this means is that there's a little tab that holds the Charge in the holster and this tab must be lightly depressed in order to extract the phone from the holster.  This tab is pretty prominent in the glamor shots of the case.  While I'm quite suspicious of this design, so far there's been no problem with the Charge popping out (although I've had the case only about 24-hours).  The belt clip on the holster allows for the holster to be rotated in 15-degree increments as is usual for the Otterbox Defender cases I'm familiar with.  There are covers for all the ports (HDMI, micro-USB, and headphone jack) and these are all well placed and seal well.  There is enough room to plug my rather sizable after-market micro-USB charge/data cable into the USB port which surprised me after reading someone else's review complaining of the need to take the Charge out of the case to charge the battery.  The volume and power buttons are all very well placed and responsive.  As compared with the cheap plastic case I had before, these buttons are all 500% more responsive and much easier to locate tactily because of the bump-outs in the neoprene.

So, with all the above why did I only give this case 4-stars?  First off, I'm a hard grader.  Secondly, I'm not impressed at how well the case seals the Charge.  There is *NO* cover to the rear facing camera, the ear piece, or the rear speaker!  I didn't look really closely but there may also be no cover to the front-facing camera or the proximity sensor.  Having experienced the 8350i and Centro Otterbox cases with some type of white cover (water absorbing?) on the speakers and ear pieces of these phones I'm quite disappointed.  I envision being out in the rain and having one single rain drop hit the ear piece and fry the phone.  I consider this a big design flaw.  Thirdly (you are still counting, right) the neoprene over the four hard-buttons along the bottom of the phone is black (""no kidding"", right?)  But this neoprene has very little for the non Braille-readers to distinguish these four buttons from one another.  So where I used to be able to grab the Charge in the dark, find the power button on the side, and then proceed visually, now I still need to fumble around to hit the four hard buttons (Menu, Home, Back, and Search).  If the neoprene were *clear* or *translucent* then this wouldn't be a problem.  Also, I find that unlike the volume and power buttons on the sides, the four buttons along the bottom take a lot of force to activate.  I attribute this to the neoprene.  And fourthly the belt clip on the holster seems *less* beefy than on the Defender case for my other two phones.  In my experience the belt clip is the weak link on these Defender cases and I wouldn't have expected that the Charge's case would be *less* strong.  But, time will tell...

Well, that's about it.  I'll try to update this review in about a month.  I hope it helps people decide what they will be doing.

### UPDATE 10jul2012 ###

The above review was from Aug2011, now it's about a year later.

I still have the phone, I still have the case.  I think I'd probably give it 3.5 stars now.  About 8-months into having the case the clip for the holster broke on my belt (remember I said the belt clip was the weak link on these cases?)  Well, Otterbox honored the warranty and sent me a whole new case (cover and holster) when I submitted a claim.  This warranty resolution was easy and and part of the reason the case doesn't get fewer stars.

Shortly before this, however, the phone fell out of the holster while I was near the water.  Long story short, the phone was submerged in about 6-inches of water for 5-minutes.  I'm pretty sure the Otterbox case on the phone helped a lot to keep out the water (the red tattle tale on the battery is barely turned) and the phone is still, knock wood, working.  But, to avoid this problem in the future, I now have the phone in a Nite Ize case&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nite-Ize-Clip-Case-Cargo-Magnet-Tall-1-Pack-Bulk-Packaging-Black/dp/B005KG46V8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nite Ize Clip Case Cargo Magnet Tall - 1 Pack - Bulk Packaging - Black</a>.  The Nite Ize case only makes the phone on my belt a hair bigger than the holster from Otterbox, and I've never had a problem with a Nite Ize clip or case.

The slot for the extra battery holds securely while charging.  The entire unit is small enough to pack for trips, and the charger connection is a standard micro USB port. The cable is short which means the base has to be very close to an outlet.  Wall outlet to desk height is about it. Since the cable detaches from the power supply, it would be very easy to replace with a longer one. Well designed product.

The only downside is that there is no extra port to connect to a PC to sync while charging.

All you do is rip the paper part of the case and the plastic part comes out and pulls apart very nicely.  You don't need to use some ancient secret magic to get the package open.

This case is built well.  It is very slim, slightly grippy but not so soft that it attracts dust or lint.  This case gives you access to all buttons and ports and has a large camera hole on the back.  One other nice feature about this case is that it has a small edge around the screen (lay on the table design).  This should protect you from minor scratches.

This case is the closest thing to perfection that I have found in my search for the perfect iPhone 4s case.

I'm very picky about photo quality so if your not finicky about that sort of thing and you want a very slim case to help you keep a grip on your iPhone.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this case but the above mentioned problem is a dealbreaker for me.

The metal corner of the iphone 5 immediately scratched the clear backing leaving a thick scratch mark.  I felt a little stupid thinking it was my fault but a co worker took it off and reinstalled the case causing an even larger scratch.  It't not our fault.  The clear back is just too soft.  We were very careful but the bottom line is that the clear backing scratches too easily just like a few of the other reviews mention. It's a shame because at first glance the case was nice looking.  The sides have a nice softish touch to it and it didn't add too much to the overall thickness and felt like a secure case.  If it scratched just on installation just imagine how bad it would look after a month. If it wasn't for the back scratching I would have kept it but it did and I sent it back to Amazon the same day.,Received and sent back for refund the same day,1349308800,3.0,,

The headset jack only supports iPhone headsets which I think is ridiculous because it should fit any headset plugged into it... Shortfall is with the case it limits your headset choices.

Not only is it small and delicate, but the way it fits in the phone requires you to practically take the whole thing apart. Also, you need to remove three pieces off the original to complete this piece. Each of these pieces are attached using that obnoxious foam that is sticky on two sides. If you're not careful, you can rip the foam in half and you won't be able to use it. Also, the plastic piece that comes off is attached with double sided tape that is cut to look like a grid so it's tough get off and reuse without folding the tape over itself.

Once the pieces are transferred over, all you need to do is put it back in! This process is tedious as well considering you have to fold and bend the flex cable the way the original was while sticking it to the original components. Fortunately this flex cable comes with the sticky portions already attached.

For those of you buying this to fix a power button that no longer depresses, you should check your phone first to see if your current power button is repairable. To do this, take your phone apart far enough to reach the two screws that hold down the power button. Once you see the flex cable with the little metal piece, see if you can press it. If you still hear it click, you can easily repair it by super gluing a very tiny piece of plastic or something that will give it a little rise. This allows the power button to be able to touch it again and make the connection. In fact, the only visible difference between this flex cable and the original is that it has a little piece of plastic on it. I didn't know this until I took the whole phone apart. Had I seen this, I would have saved the money and just fixed my power button since it was still working. Live and learn I guess.","Difficult install, but worth every penny.",1326499200,48.0,,

I've had it for a week or so, and it's holding up so far.

Pros:
 - Lightweight
 - Fairly easy to put on and remove from belt.

Cons:
 - Body plastic is fairly flimsy
 - The retaining clip which keeps the phone from falling out of the holster is very blocky with hard edges. It can and does dig into your side.
 - Difficult to get the phone out of the holster. There is only a small area next to the retaining clip to get your finger into once you release the clip.

I work in a warehouse environment, so we'll have to see how well it holds up.

Update June 17, 2012: Well, I've broken two of these now. The first was doing fine until I was getting out of the passenger seat of my wife's tiny car. I'm right-handed, so it was on my right side, and caught on the door frame of the car. The holster made very little fuss as the clip snapped right off.

The second one broke today. We were looking at furniture, and I sat in a recliner. The belt clipped snapped off when the phone was pressed against me and the chair arm. I guess the Spanish Inquisition were right in their use of the comfy chair as a torture device (j/k).

So, I've downgraded the rating from 3 to 2, and won't be buying another one. Instead I've just spent $40 on a holster/case combo. Stay away from this holster, unless you never move.","Works, but has a few rough edges",1335744000,5.0,,

So in direct light this thing should have no issue charging any USB device as the standard is 5V 1 Amp so it will have some power left over.

Most USB battery backups that charge off of usb only take 1amp also so charging one of these should be no issue. I have a 4000mAh backup that it charges just fine. I am thinking of getting a 8000mAh USB chargeable and putting that inside the pouch always hooked up to the panel.

I was excited about the unlocked European Galaxy Note as I love WACOM screens.  My problem is that the Android operating systems on both the Note and the HTC Inspire seems awkward and buggy compared the iOS.  So here I am, 4 months in advance of my subsidized upgrade with AT&T, trying to determine whether I'll bite on the iPhone 5 or something else.  I read about  Windows Phone with interest, as prior to my first iPhone, I had several different Windows phones with the earlier operating systems. I figured I'd try Windows Phone 7.5 in the no-contract Nokia.

Positives
The phone works very well as a phone - great reception and volume, virtually no dropped calls
Windows Phone OS is easy to use
Syncs well with our exchange server
Screen is great
Office apps
Kindle works well
Nokia Drive is very useful, specially the latest version that allows downloaded state maps
My first LTE phone, and web connectivity is FAST

Negatives
Apps - if by the time my upgrade is available (February), the Starbucks and Sugarsync apps are not available in either 7.5 or 8, it will be a deal-breaker for me.  Those are  ""must-haves""

The voice-command cannot be disabled (at least I haven't found a way to do it).  If windows phone 8 does not have the ability to disable voice command, it will be another deal-breaker. I hate the fact that Apple will not allow you to disable the iPod app, and consequently I cannot have any music on my phone, as it will begin to blare music in meetings and movie theaters, even  when on silent.  At least Apple allows you to disable voice dialing.  I cannot use a blue-tooth headset without a simple physical on-off switch.  It is arrogant of Apple and Microsoft to not allow the disabling of these features.

The viability of Nokia.  I hope they are able to survive as they make great phones.

Not the fault of the phone, but it was advertised s ""New"", and it arrived with the seal on the box broken.  It looked unused and it has worked flawlessly, but still ..

Bottom line for me will be the features and apps available in Windows 8.  From what I've read, apps that are available for Windows 8 on the PC will be easy for developers to port to Windows phone.  If that is the case, I'm optimistic that my must-have apps will be available.  I'm looking forward to getting my hands on the Nokia 920 in the next few weeks, as it looks like my device of choice if I stay with Windows Phone.

I wanted a case that was cheap enough where I wouldn't feel bad buying. The purpose is to find a well respected case brand that can offer great protection (from my 5 year old) after which I may change into a better case in the future as more manufacturers make cases and the selection is wider.

First impression: Felt just like an Incase case with the smooth matte finish. Very sturdy and protects the phone well. This pretty much doubles the weight of the phone and so the phone feels sturdy and protected in the hands. I can definitely feel it in my pocket now. The buttons are cushy and easy to press. I wouldn't be worried if I dropped the phone.

Things I notice of why I am only giving it 4 stars: As mentioned by another reviewer, it does collect pocket dust easily and is not easy to rub off with your hands. Maybe a cloth will help. The silicon on the two sides of the case where the buttons are easy to move around. This is the nature of soft silicon, but it would have been better if that area was a little stiffer instead of moving around. It would have been nice if the silicone was built with out a separate mold. I hate lines. Another thing is that the silicon at the top of the case does not look as clean and smooth as the bottom. I'm not sure why, maybe a molding issue, but it doesn't bother me all that much.

I think it's a great deal for the price. Will have to see how the case holds up after a few weeks of use. Hopefully the paint won't peel like my Incase did (iPhone) awhile back.

People who are critical of the Symbian OS based on past experiences are really missing out with the version of Symbian on this phone (Belle FP2).

I had the Nokia N8 also, and this phone is light years ahead of that phone in performance. Nokia Belle FP2 is a smooth and polished OS now compared to previous versions on older phones.

I can stream music from the internet, and surf the web at the same time now without any lag or performance issues.
Multi-tasking is amazing on this phone.

While Nokia store is slowing down, and nowhere near the level of Apple and Android app stores, there are still tons of great apps and games for Symbian. (also no Nokia Music store on the 808 for USA, only for Lumia phones here)

Also not a lot of accessories for this phone, but since it has bluetooth & NFC chip, you can use a lot of accessories even made for other phones.
This phone will also take a 64GB micro SD, which is awesome.

Also... the CR-122 Nokia car holder that I used for my N8 fits the 808, if you are looking for a good car holder.

The manual (and online installation videos) mentioned removing tab 2. When you remove tab 1, you pull off a perfectly clear layer, and what is left is a hazy opaque layer. This leaves you to believe there will be another layer to peel off, but there isn't. At first I thought they'd forgotten to put a 2nd tab on all of my sheets, but the last bit of the instructions does mention you may only have 1 layer. My first try had too many bubbles (sometimes you get tiny ones that just won't go away, no matter how hard you try). The 2nd attempt got a piece of lint or something that floated between the screen as I applied it. The 3rd time was near perfect. Don't try and line it up exactly on the edges...it will be off-center from the camera if you do that. You need to give it a little less than a 16th of an inch at the bottom and edge. My only concern is when you are getting rid of bubbles...since you don't have a 2nd layer to peel off after removing bubbles, it is possible to scratch the plastic if you push too hard and your fingernail or other object is touching the screen.

I read the reviews on this LG800G and at first did not go for it because of some of the negative comments.  The phone arrived priorty Mail 5 days after I ordered it.  Inside the box was the familiar Tracfone package and the LG800G life time triple minute phone inside.  Also a sheet of paper explaining how to add the minutes and the pin number for the minutes on the same sheet of paper.  Activating the phone first online was easy(phone comes with 20 minutes), then adding the 400 minute 1 year (1200 after tripling) minutes using the tracfone online site also worked fine and i got 1220 minutes and 425 days of service.  This is the best way to deal with Tracfone...add minutes online.  My main gripe is the touch screen.  First it feels like frosted plastic.  Second it is not as senstative to touch as I hoped for.  I have an Ipod 4th generation and so I am spoiled.  I put a screen protector on it as soon as i could because it just seems very ""scratchable"".  I was concerned about accidental  Internet ""browsing"" but I was able to move the Icon for that off the main screen.  Also I tried the browser very breifly and it was just .5 unit for under the minute i was connected.  It gave me a warning I was about to go online and gave me the option to back out.  I did not go any further with that until I find the manual for the phone that is suppose to be somewhere on the Tracfone Website.  The Manual that comes with the phone (English and Spanish) is not bad for basic use but not enough for all the options. It doesnt tell you want happens after you hit the browser Icon...It will be trial and error as your minutes get used up. Text message was .3 unit and seems fine.  I have not talked on it yet but don't expect that to be any less than what I am accustomed to with my older Tracfone. This LG800G phone is ok but don't expect good touch experience. I wanted the ablilty to occasionally get on the web to check email and that is why i upgraded to this level. I liked the design of the Tracfone T404G slide out keyboard but was concerned about the many accidental browser button mishaps reported in the reviews...no touch screen to compalin about with that phone...so I did not get it...mabye I should have gotten it?  There is my remorse.  I am going to keep the LG 800G phone anyway.  I did not order a USB Cable because I have so many cables I thought i would have one that fits...WRong!  LG cable needed for this phone.  There is a $2.5O  cable on Amazon that I just orded today...includes shipping.  If you don't have the cable you can't connect the phone to your PC to put things on the micro sd card ( you need to buy that too)...it sits under the battery inside the phone...that would be a hassle to remove it everytime you wanted to add or delete MP3 songes or whatever to the card ( and mabye lose all yur settings you made on the phone)...so you will need the cable.  The 1200 one year minute deal is great  so I am happy with that.  Tracfone is still in my opinion a good way to go for people who want mobile phone use at the lowest possible cost.

The package comes with the battery, case, charger and even a lanyard(can't find out how to put it on the phone). The charger's pretty good, you can charge a battery directly and a phone from an usb cable at the same time. Surprisingly the back cover is made out of the same material the original one is made of. The cover snapped on tight and it fits perfectly. It is a bit thick (4 mm) but it's understandable. The battery lasts at least 10 hours with moderate-heavy usage without any breaks. Usually it lasts at least 2 days with light usage, which is not bad for the price. When I received it it had about 60% charge, I fully drained it fully charged it again, repeated it and it works great. Just don't expect it to last 20 hours with 3d gaming :P. You get what you pay for.

PROS: -Lasts at least 2x longer than stock battery
  -Doesn't heat as much as stock battery
  -Case is made of soft brushed plastic like original one
  -Not too thick
  -The charger can charge 2 batteries at once(The battery directly and the USB to the phone)
  -It's pretty light
  -The cover feels stronger and more secure

CONS: -No lens on the cover
  -Not exactly a 3500 mah battery(It's a little lower but still over 3000 mah)
  -Can't fit a protective case on it (yet)

Again, you get what you pay for. If you want something that lasts 24 hours on heavy usage, but a Mugen 4500 mah battery for $100. Just remember, if the life of the battery seems poor do a few cycles; fully drain, fully charge fully drain, etc...

The size is good, it fits in my briefcase or pocket nicely and is easy to travel with. I use the light more than I thought I would. The carrying pouch is a nice touch.
In addition to the fact that it works, the charger has an excellent look and feel. It's obviously not a toy as is the case with some of the others.
The blue lights that show status and charge capacity are a very nice plus.

It comes equipped with cables that will work with most of the popular manufacturer's power input ports.

Be aware that iTorch itself doesn't come with a wall plug but if you shop around on the net you can get one thrown in the deal for practically nothing.

It will charge my iPhone from 20% to 85% in about two hours and will go higher given more time. I had hoped it would give a little bit more boost to my iPad than it does but the New Trent website description clearly states that it has 35% of iPad battery capacity so I have no issue here.

I have a small farm and work outside with no access to AC power from dawn till dusk on weekends. I like to listen to Spotify, Pandora, and NPR while working. My iPhone 4 battery just doesn't have enough power to support that kind of use. For day long use, I usually just leave it plugged in the iPhone and the two batteries work together. The IMP52D keeps the music and entertainment coming - I have never exhausted it!

Mine was charged out of the box. As needed, just plug it in and it charges up to full quickly.

I don't know how long it will hold a full charge without using it. I've gone several days without using it and didn't see a noticeable degradation in charge. After the Sandy storm disaster, this might be a good thing to have and keep charged up. In an emergency, if used sparingly, the IMP52D will extend your cell phone capabilities by many hours.

Only after I wrote my initial review below, I realize I mistook the top protective layer as the screen protector. The actual screen protector is crystal clear and smooth to slide your fingers on. Now, I end up applying it to the back of my phone but I still like it. So far, no scratches observed. Since it's made of firm film, it's much easier to apply than a name brand product (comes with squeegee and solution) that claims to be military grade. The one caveate is to make sure you apply it in a dust-free area or as close to it as possible.

A few little pieces have also started to come loose on the edges.  I give it about another month or two and it should be toast!

My Otterbox Defender lasted exactly one year.  After several drops, the plastic inside the silicone case started to crack, causing the overall structure to give.... This Ballistic case is a replacement for the Otterbox.  It came in a plain plastic bag with a barcode and no instructions.  When all put together it feels heavier than the Otterbox and slightly bulkier because of the raised silicone grips.  My first complaint is how easy the outer silicone case comes off.  I don't think it will take long for it to get looser to where I will be constantly pulling and stretching the skin back over the plastic case.  It covers the entire back, but then only comes around the front four corners. I don't know about simply using the inner plastic case without the silicone because like other cases it will most likely pop open if dropped. I do like how the port covers stick into the ports and the external speakers sound better than the otterbox.  I never used the otterbox belt clip because it always felt like a good bump would send it flying off the holder.  This case clips in and locks really good.  Both cases are made in CHINA, so we will see how it does long term.

***UPDATE**** I can't really use that outer silicone case because it is way too big.  Hard to get into a pocket (sticky/bulky) and I cannot use another enclosed belt clip case I had for my otterbox or use the same vehicle mount phone holder I was using.  So far just the inner case is working fine.  I haven't dropped it yet, so yet to see if the phone will stay in it, or split apart and fall out like other snap cases.  It is tough to find a 3.5MM jack that will fit in the phone now because the inner case has a small opening around it.  You will have to get one with a slim plug base.  As one reviewer described, the far left and right screen functions occasional get funky as the case pops out a bit at the edges. You find yourself really trying to get your finger tip in there just right to activate whatever is on the screen.  Dropped it a few times and the case has popped open slightly in the corners, but no full on phone flying out of the case yet.","Looks okay, we will see how it holds up",1335484800,3.0,,

Today, however, it impressed me beyond what I expected. I am an avid cyclist and have a mount on my handlebars to use apps while I ride that measures distance etc. While out riding this afternoon, I accidentally hit the quick release button on my mount that opens the tension clips which holds the phone in. It happened to occur while I was riding downhill at about 15 MPH. Without me having time to react, the phone flew out of the now-open mount. I watched in horror as my phone smacked into the frame of my bike and then tumbled down the hill like a stone. All in all it went about 20 feet, landing face first on the street. Fearing the absolute worst, I raced to pick up my phone and was so incredibly surprised and thankful to find that it was in PERFECT condition - not a single scratch or crack! The worst that happened was there was some dirt on the screen. The Otterbox case took the hit and even that looks pretty darn good in my opinion considering - a couple of small hairline cracks around the camera hole and on the bottom and scuffing on the edges but the case it still very much usable - you can't even see this damage unless you look closely.

The company only seemed to make this for Apple products so I searched for something similar for my new EVO since I use RunKeeper Pro to track my runs.

DESIGN:
The Design is pretty straight forward.  It does not exactly fit the EVO, it took a lot of squeezing in there to get it to fit.  Not really a problem.  I was not a fan of the plastic cover on the armband to begin with, but seeing as I was limited in selection, it would have to do.

OVERALL:
I would take this on medium runs (5-8 miles)for about an hour.  The phone got wet from my sweat and the plastic cover fogged over making reading the screen useless.  I have stopped using the product and am now out the $25 that I spent on it.

I would not recommend this to any EVO owner as its more of a ""one size fits all"" approach.  Maybe some other phones work better, but the condensation on the inside of an armband with a $500+ phone inside didn't sit well with me at all.

I quickly realized that the 'fun' plastic cover on the back wasn't doing anything to protect the most fragile element of my phone. I knew I needed something that had a bit of a ""lip"" to the front part, so that it would hopefully cushion another fall. An entirely silicone case was not an option, either. I often put my phone in my pants, jacket or shirt pocket. While offering a lot of cushion, silicone covers tend to ""stick"" in those areas.

This Otter Box Commuter case was the perfect blend of plastic rigidity and silicone cushion. It fits perfectly and provides me with a sense of relief that it would be a little better protected than before. The color choices aren't bad, either. I've seen other reviews mentioning the annoying flaps that cover the charging/docking port and the headphone jack. I'm okay with those little flaps, though. They keep dust out and are not that big of a deal to me.

One final note: there is a similar Otter Box that has colored silicone and a semi-translucent plastic 'cover.' The one I have has black silicone and a dark blue plastic part - I love how it looks.

The extension cable locks well to my iPhone and iPad.  I prefer cords that lock nicely, especially when I use them in my car so that it stays connected during road vibrations as it sits on the seat next to me.  The extension also works to both sync and charge, showing me that all wires are properly connected.  If you attach this extension to a regular sync cord it'll be much thicker and stiffer.  The connectors are about 1 mm or so larger than the factory ones in width and thickness, and about 3 mm larger in height.

The sync cord is about the same as the factory version.  I felt this was a good value as a spare sync cord to keep in a travel bag.  The sync cord has the shorter connector and does not lock on.  It works to charge my phone when attached to my standard charger.  It also works to sync my phone with my computer through a USB port.  The connectors are almost identical in size to the factory ones, though the top edge is not rounded like the factory versions.

The extension cable is 39"" long end to end
The sync cord is 73"" long end to end

The velcro wrap strap is handy for keeping the cable looped when stored in my glove box.

My VW has an iPod-iPhone connection that is difficult to use due to a very short cable.  I use this iPhone extension cable in the car and it works well.  This means I'm happy with my purchase and was able to accomplish everything I hoped for with the purchase.

*** Update 25May2012 ***
After a couple months of daily use attacking the extension cord to my phone in the car as I commute home, I started to have a problem with the connector where it attaches to the phone.  Turns out the locking mechanism was locking a little too tightly.  The case for the connector has opened up and the metal piece that holds the lock in place came loose.  I decided to take that metal piece out and funny enough, it's working even better now.  It doesn't lock in place with a click but it does stay very securely.  I'm lowering the rating from 4 stars to 3 because I shouldn't have to fiddle with it coming apart and fix it.  I am happy that it's still working and will keep using it.  I do think this tells me the connector isn't the highest quality, it should last longer than a few months.  I have Apple branded connectors I've used daily for years now without them failing.

It fits perfectly on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Exhibit-II-4G/dp/B00607JBNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Exhibit II 4G</a>.  Of the pictures amazon currently shows for this item, only one exactly matches the item I received - the one which shows both pieces at a diagonal without the phone.  It has a round dimple at the bottom and an extra 2 small holes on the back side next to the speaker phone opening.

This case is thin hard flexible plastic and fits tightly on the phone.  It snaps together easily and can be removed without breaking by running my fingernail between the two sides.  There is a slot on the bottom right where you can start - just go all around the phone and the clips pop apart easily.  When I installed it, my phone was fairly new and still had the original screen protector on it.  I cut off the side tab from the screen protector and snapped on the case.  I'm glad I didn't rush to pull this off; the touch screen works great with it left on.

The feel is slightly rubbery, smooth but not too slick.  It doesn't slide out of my hand but isn't very grippy either.  The openings all match everything perfectly, including camera and flash, volume, power, USB, headphones, mic, and rear speaker.  I'm not sure what the 2 small holes are for on the back but they don't cause any trouble.  Maybe they were for something on a prototype version of the phone.  The only thing you won't have access to is the battery compartment, but as I said, you can pop the sides apart fairly easily.

After about a month of use, the case is like new, and seems like it will last for years unless I abuse it.  I haven't dropped it yet, so I can't speak from experience, but looking it over, it seems like it would sufficiently protect the phone from damage for a short fall.  It is harder, thinner plastic so I wouldn't recommend throwing it or dropping it onto concrete from more than a couple feet.

This is an attractive, quality case well worth the few dollars I spent on it.

UPDATE 12/10/12

Still works great.  I've dropped it about 6 times from about 3 to 4 feet onto carpet, hard floors and pavement.  No damage to the phone at all, and barely marked the case.  Sometimes the case pops open when it hits a hard surface, and I just snap it back together no problem.  Excellent case.",SF Planet sent a nice case made by Fosmon,1341705600,5.0,,

Installation was easy, the bubbles are easy to get rid of, I found a tiny lint after the install, followed the instruction and got rid of it using a piece of tape. The film is very clear, as if it was never there, the same friend of mine who got the other protector ordered this one after seeing how well it fits.

Touch screen response is excellent; the only minor complaint I have is it attracts fingerprint, but can be cleaned easily. Since it is more like a plastic film than the rubbery film like some invisible shields, I am suprised that it did not have any tiny scratch while using the included plastic bubble remover. So it passed my initial durability test, i shall see how well it lasts after month or two.

If you're a data user, reading this post can't help you that much. I have no data plan, so I never used wifi, or any of the Internet stuff on this phone. I read on some other post, that this phone needs data plan to set up, (so you don't pay extra money just to set up the phone). When I first had it, it didn't need data plan to set up.  Overall the phone's decent enough, just some minor issues that I wanna point out.

The calling feature is good. It is a touch screen but one needs to unlock the screen in order to answer.(unless the screen is already unlocked) So, you shouldn't need to worry about answering or rejecting a call by accident.  And it stores your calls real good. I have this phone for four weeks or so. It stores my calls from the first day I got it.

The texting feature is quite bad. Though it stores all your conversation from every contact in your phone. It doesn't give you time. If you want to go back and look for a message, there's no way it can tell you what time you got it. or what time you sent it. If you send or receive the message today, it will give you exact time of when you send or receive the message. But when it's the next day, the messages from before will appear as yesterday. As time goes on, they will appear as last week, two weeks ago, three weeks ago and such. There's no way to tell what time or even what day you've gotten or received those messages.  It's pretty small thing missing on a smart phone, i found it ridiculous.

The camera feature is bad. If there was enough light, and your hand don't shake. The pictures come out decent enough. But there's no way on this phone to adjust ANYTHING at all. When you open the camera app, it just gives a shutter and a flash to snap picture. There's no way to adjust brightness, contract, zoom-in, zoom-out. Nothing. You have a shutter and you're stuck with it.  I even have more option on my old basic phone. The video feature is okay, I'll say. But still it will be better if you can have control over SOME stuff.

The battery life really isn't good. It takes away lot battery life when you turn it off(stand-by. not shut it down). I forgot to charge this phone one time and I had about 15% battery life left. I didn't use this phone for the whole afternoon and when I got home the phone was long dead. Talk on the phone for half an hour take away almost half of the battery. I don't even use the internet and I charge this phone constantly. NOTE: THERE'S A OPINION, ""LEAVE WIFI ON WHEN THE PHONE'S ASLEEP"" DONT CHOOSE THAT. You'll fall asleep with a fully charged phone and wake up with a dead phone.

Other than that, I'll say the vibration of this phone is subtle, weak and close to nothing. You can put it right on your table in front of you while doing something and don't even notice it vibrates, let along put it in your purses or bags. You won't check a message or notice a missed call till half hour, one hour later. My suggestion is, if you have to put the phone on vibrate, check your phone constantly. Or just hold it in your hand. That's the only way you'll know when you get a message or call.",decent enough but have some minor issues,1334534400,2.0,,

---------------------------------

Was forced to enter the 21ST century and get a smart phone. I was happy with my dumb barely a feature phone. It made phone calls and that's what I need a phone for.
I like this thing its huge thin and works

There have been some complaints in the forums about screen problems I don't have any of them.

Pros:
Shinny.
I really like it
carrier unlocked
big but then I have large baseball mitts for hands
does fit nicely in a standard dress shirt pocket or suit coat pocket
Barely fits in a front pants pocked. Don't put it in your back pocked if you do you will only do it once and then have to get new phone.
thinner than an iPhone and 2 of the Apple sheeple I work with are already lusting over it.
really nice screen
physical home button
no carrier bloat/crap-ware
not an AT&T phone
will work fine on AT&T
has a slightly faster processor than the AT&T I717 variant
works on T-Mobile although with slower data
did't need to extend contract
my old plan doesn't have data and is cheaper than anything they offer now.
Plays YOUTube videos nicely over WiFi
removable battery
old school s-pen stylus is nice for those of us with big baseball mitt fingers.
The phone is responsive so far no real lag and seems faster then the coworkers phones we compared it to
Boot time is about the same as my old ""just a phone"" phone
Nice build quality does not feel cheap
Micro SD card slot up to 32GB

cons:
big those with small hands should think about one of its littler Galaxy brothers
does not have T-Mobile 1700 MHz data Band so only slow edge data for now
It is rumored that T-Mobile will be getting 1900mHz data some time in 2013 we will see if it happens when it happens
has Euro WIFI settings so US A/N 5.0 GHZ issue see XDA-developers Wiki for a fix
Only supports up 32GB micro SD card
only 16GB internal memory
The s-pen stylus is a little small and clumsy for those of us with big baseball mitt fingers.
I will have to get one of the full size s-pen pen-stylus'

That's right, I said ALL.  Within 1 year of purchasing the PhoneSuit Elite, I have had 4 replacements!  That's a total of 5 units!

While the battery life of the PhoneSuit Elite appears to dwarf some similar products (A fully charged PSE will fully charge an iPhone 4 from about 5% and still have a bit left in the tank.), the quality leaves much to be desired.  Specifically, I've listed some of the issues below:

* The on/off button didn't work on 2 of my units.
* The PSE would not simultaneously charge my iPhone and PSE; I had to charge the PSE, then charge the iPhone separately, and then charge back up the PSE.
* Somewhat related to the above issue, when plugged into my computer to sync my iPhone, the PSE cannot seem to invoke the appropriate connection.  In other words, before connecting to the computer, I turn the PSE on (It begins to charge.); as soon as I connect the USB cable, the PSE ceases to charge/connect, making it impossible to connect to the computer ""through"" the PSE.  I have to take the PSE completely off and use the standard 30-pin connector.
* The top clips are flimsy and slide off the phone very easily.  Imagine trying to retrieve the phone from your front pocket and pulling the top clip off or pulling the phone out leaving the clip in your pocket.  Plus, they break frequently.
* All of the battery indicators don't work on my most recent replacement.

Anyways, I hope this helps people.  It's important to note that customer service is marginal.  I have had to pay S&H on at least 2 replacements and had to ask specifically the other 2 times.

2. I had an easy install since I already had a hole in the ceiling from installing a network cable, so it was easy to thread the cable up to the first floor. If you needed to create a new hole in your ceiling and floor, maybe not so easy.

Although I had seen these similar complaints at Amazon, I considered this accessory a necessity and bought it anyway. I don't regret it and this is why: I trust Motorola products

I just got off the phone with Motorola. (spoke with Claire)
They agreed to send me a FREE replacement - the entire package.
They only ask that you send back the broken item with 30 days, or they'll charge you $49.99
Problem solved!

I also asked Claire if I would have to pay for return shipping.
She said YES - but added ""just call back with your RMA number and we will issue you a FREE shipping label"".
(the RMA number is sent to your email)

In Summary:
The replacement will cost me nothing
Motorola stood behind their product, as I predicted
I am happy!

Particularly if they take abuse and start to look cruddy after a year.

This cover fits the bill. The volume rocker is hard to operate through the rubber (I've since cut out the space over the rocker switch), but that's fine, I use Llama profiles and HTC Sense personalization to manage the ringtone and other volume levels, and a Bluetooth headset to manage the in-call volume. Only complaint about this budget case is that the makers must have thought there was a plug (HDMI?) at the bottom and left a hole there (no, not the normal mic, or the larger mic hole for speakerphone mode). Ooops! The button on the bottom is for releasing the phone's back cover, something you'd NEVER do with this case on it. Oh, well. $20 saved is better for me than perfection.

I previously (from another source locally) purchased what appears to be this exact case, knowing it was vinyl since I looked at it in person, and purchased it since I couldn't find one that fit my phone as well as this one in leather.  It lasted about 2 or 3 weeks and the belt clip sheered right off of the case and dropped to the ground one day.

The unit does indeed charge BOTH the phone and a battery at the same time at the normal rate.  The trick is, you've GOT to use the wall wart that comes with it.  A standard USB charger will not give enough power to charge both (or either), and the supplied charger will output the 1 full amp that this unit needs.  I believe the USB spec for run of the mill chargers is 750ma, or 3/4 the power of this one.  Now, if the Chinese engineers that designed this thing would have allowed full flow to just one side of the charger (either the phone or the external battery bay) using a standard 750ma charger, then this would have been a perfect unit.  But it's really no big thing, just use the charger that comes with it and that's that.  Using the supplied charger, you can charge one at a time or both at the same time with no problem.  (Some wall outlets nowadays have built-in USB chargers that will NOT work with this device).

You learn pretty quick how to pop it in and out with just one hand.  Build quality is surprisingly good.  Solid, well built.  The only thing it's missing is a separate status LED for the phone - the only LED on the unit (there's only one) just monitors the external batt charger, which works fine.  But no LED status for the phone.  Then again, the phone will tell you on the opening screen when it's being charged.

Samsung gladly added a mandatory battery-full alert to the latest version of Android OS, so when the battery tops off in the middle of the night it'll sound alarms and go to full bright, thus waking up you, the dog and possibly the War Dept.  This was removed going from 2.2 to 2.3 to protect us from ourselves I'm sure.

It was very easy to install and works as described.  The ""chime"" that it replaces the factory chime with is a bit awkward sounding at first, but it isn't all that bad.

Just incase you're not entirely sure what this does...  In some vehicles (I'm not sure exactly which ones so you'll have to do your own research), the factory installed radios control various other functions such as the chimes.  In my 2004 Envoy, the radio also stays on after you turn off the truck until you open a door.  This feature and the chimes are lost if you remove the factory radio without using the GMOS-01 adapter.

Just make sure it functions properly BEFORE you button everything up!  I received a faulty unit the first time around and had to wait for a couple of days to get a new one.  If your chimes don't work  (the unit's default volume is loud enough) or if the radio stays on after you open your door, then it's a bad unit.

OH, and don't forget to buy an antenna adapter as well if you're installing into a newer GM!

So IF you don't have some pressing need for a smart phone this is still the best thing going and I used one for over 5 years and in many ways still miss it.
--------------------------------------------

Well I have had an Alias 2 for over 2 years now and I love it, best phone I ever had.  just so you understand I use my phone mainly as a PHONE, I do a lot of txting and it is great for that.  The menus are all clear and it won't pocket dial people.  I would like to point out that some of the early models had a problem with Bluetooth which was resolved with a software fix.  I am looking around to buy an extra for when mine dies since Verizon does not carry them any longer on their website.  The key board is great and I have not found anything that I like better for carrying in my front jeans pocket and I can set it to vibrate AND play any mp3 I wish as a ringtone.  Whats not to like??

UPDATE:  Well here I am in Jan 2013 and still have this same phone, still like it and fight the urge to move on to a ""smart"" phone.  Unless you really want a smart phone that will be lucky to get through a 24 hour period without being recharged this is still the best phone.  I have the extended battery and I can go for 3-5 days without a recharge and the coverage is excellent.  Anything I get to replace it in the future will be a step down as an actual phone (which is why we got these things wasn't it?).

UPDATE:  It is Oct 2013 and my phone of 4 years was going strong but I dropped it just right to break the front screen (it was still working but looked bad) so I used a Alias 2 backup I had and took it to the Verizon store and got it cloned then bought a factory refurbished Alias 2 (to replace the backup) from one of the vendors on this page for $42, looks new but until they make a smart phone with a physical QWERTY keyboard and a battery that lasts for 3-6 days, I am keeping this phone.  Still better than anything out there IMHO since I have a PC, iPad, laptop I can use to access the Net, I really don't need it on my phone.

It took all of two minutes to install it using the very easy, four-step instructions. All you have to do is simply clean your phone using the included cloth, peel the protector backing, apply, and smooth out the bubbles. No complicated fuss. If you mess up the installation (as I did the first time), you can simply peel the protector back and reapply, not to mention that there are two more included.

On the downside, there is one pain in the tuckus that almost made me remove a star. The backing and the protector itself each have a little sticker tab on them to make it easier to separate the two. However, once the protector is installed, the sticker is ridiculously hard to get off the thing completely. This step took 3/4 of the total time.

After that, though, I have absolutely no complaints. The screen protector literally invisible once installed. It does make the phone touch capability a little more resistive, but the pressure required is still very slight.

I highly recommend the product for the $4 (with shipping) I paid for it. I plan on giving one to a friend of mine who has the same phone and keeping the other as a spare. Would order again.

The front lip just basically sits right on the edge of the phone.

The only recommendation I can make to speck is to make the front lip of the top and bottom, where the home button and ear piece are, have the case come further onto the phone there as your finger never goes there and nothing is being impeded.

The keyboard it amazing, and is backlit really nicely, which makes texting when it's dark not so hard on your eyes. Also I really like the software that runs this phone. It is a little weird at first, but it's really great how you can change the color of the theme. Next, I DID NOT have to pay for a data plan on this phone; I only use the wifi, which works perfectly.
  The best feature of this phone is the music part. The Kin two runs Zune, which if you don't know is basically just a media player, but in my opinion is way better than iTunes. When you get the phone, you just plug it in to your computer and from there it is extremely easy to set up an account and put songs on to your phone. This phone does not take a micro SD card (which I found was a little disappointing at first) but it does have 8 gigabytes of internal memory, and I have not gotten even remotely close to filling all of it (even with 350 songs and lots of photos and videos).
  Another feature that mimics a smart phone is the camera. Just like most smart phones, this particular phone has an 8 megapixel camera that takes really nice pictures, and has an impressively nice video. On the theme of emulating a smart phone, the Kin also has a sleep (or lock) button on the top right corner on the edge of the device, which is a great feature.
  For the money, this is, by a landslide, the best phone I have ever owned (and I have owned about 5 phones). Everything is really easy to use, the display is awesome, the music software is sweet, the camera has amazing resolution, it does 3G AND/OR wifi, and the keyboard is kick a**.
The only downfall I have noticed, not even about the phone, is that if you like to put cases on your phones, I would not recommend putting one on this one because to begin with this phone is mildly fat. The case that I bought ended up being very thick by itself, and when I put it on, the entire phone was huge. I would recommend just buying a screen protector, because their about a buck and a half on Amazon.

*NOTE: This confused me at fist to: if you cover the light sensor (top right hand corner of the device) and then try to turn it on, the device WILL NOT turn on. This is so it doesn't turn on in your pocket.

My thought was that even though this one goes for hours of talk time between charges, there are times when I travel that charging is not an option. My thought was ""backup"". The sound quality is good. Generally everyone was happy on the other end which is not always the case with bluetooth headsets. At my end, it was able to go louder than most. That comes in handy in airports or other noisy environments. The reversible ear clip not only works well, but unlike some sets I have owned, it fits flat and rotates to work for either ear. You don't have to mess around with a bag of spare parts. It's flat enough to go in a shirt pocket without protruding too much, so dealing with it when not in use is good.

So why only 4 stars? By October, it was deader than a doornail. I normally get a year to two years before a headset just dies. This one was a lot shorter than that. And while it may not matter to some, the charger connection is a proprietary round connector I have not experienced before. That means you may need to plan for additional purchases for car or AC adaptors. Other sets I have owned have had USB mini connectors which are the same as my Blackberry and Android phones. Also, the one I purchased in May came as some kind of OEM bundle, with a car charger included, and one AC adaptor with detachable USB end, so it can also work off the side of a laptop. I do like this well enough to replace it with the same model, pending whatever Plantronics does for warranty. If they do replace it, I will have the two I initially wanted. The set that I just purchased this week arrived yesterday from Cellular Boys, via Amazon Prime. It had only a conventional AC charger that does not include the USB attachment, nor car charger. It was also about $8 less than the first one, so it's still a good deal.

It did protect the phone, but the case got loose on that top corner.

I did this and the whole upper third of the case snapped off. Now i put the case on successfully two or three other times before, but this time it snapped.

After picking up the Galaxy Nexus, like most, I was shocked to find how quickly the battery depletes...even with the screen dimmed all the time.  It wasn't even a full 24 hours before I was off and looking for the extended battery.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it not only cost less then I'd thought, but was substantially thinner than most extended batteries end up being.  No ugly bulge, no off-colored covers.  In all actuality, you can't even tell you have it.

I will say that I wasn't too impressed to find that the replacement battery was only 250mAh larger than the stock 1850mAh battery.  Even so, at 2100mAh I was still happy to have a longer battery life, even if it was only about 14% more.  The difference in thickness is almost negligible, as you would only notice when holding them next to each other.  However, the difference after installing the battery is hardly, and I mean HARDLY noticeable.  Although the difference is minor, the phone does come with an ever-so-slightly larger cover for the back of the phone, which matches the stock completely when it comes to cosmetics.  Most cases will even fit over the back with the extended battery installed, even many that weren't designed for it.  That should help to further express how small the difference is.

One might ask the question then...why wasn't this offered as the stock battery?  My guess would be to keep the phone slimmed down as much as possible, as it seems to be in head-to-head contention with the thinnest smartphone out there (as of 1/19/12), the Droid Razr.  The other reason seems obvious...profit.  I mean, why wouldn't you want to buy this battery?!  Samsung's not stupid...they know this line of thought too.

Anyhow, quick pros and cons summary for prospect buyers out there:

Pros:
-14% more battery life
-Almost negligible thickness for an extended battery
-Cost is very reasonable

Cons:
-Why wasn't this the original battery?
-Dimensionally, still thicker than OEM

It is what it is...a battery offering a little more power.  From personal use, I've noticed a difference, but I'd only say an extra hour or so...which matches up with the original math of about 14% more power.  Something to keep in mind; doesn't it seem funny how the last hour or so of your phone always seems like when you need it most?

Lastly, the style is unisex; in spite of having ""pearl"" in its name, it looks fine for both men and women.

It cost me about $30 for a very basic flip phone and about $15 a month depending on my talk time. It worked on Sprint's network which is fine in larger cities and near highways, but is not as good as Tracfone's reception bars in less populated areas.

This is a much better phone than the few STI offers, with many of the features like camera, video, MP3 player, my STI phone lacked. And buying it and a year's tripled minutes made it cheaper than continuing with STI.

Of course you don't get an Iphone at this price, and heavier users can get unlimited plans from a variety of Prepaid companies for around $40 a month.

But for convenience when away from home and a small handy music player (can use bluetooth to play through some headphones or car stereos too)this unit holds it's charge for days, and has alarms, memos and other convenience features  that all seem to work well.

I couple this with the new MagicJack PLUS as my home phone for unlimited talk from there via the internet.

As for the phone it just works.  It handles the newest apps and games without any issue. Some may wish for a ""vanilla"" android experience but after using a phone like that i find Samsungs Touchwiz interface a nice improvement.  I could re hash all the good stuff about this phone but for that you can read the other reviews.  As for issues, which i may be alone on.  I find the internal memory partitioning to be confusing at best.  Theres a main system partition of 1 gig then a second 2 gig partion called usb memory. Thats all well and good but most apps that don't have custom save settings don't have a selection for it.  I use an external memory card but this space seems a little odd.  It seems like they wanted to give you some protected memory for music i guess its kind of odd. please comment if you know whats up with it.  On to other things.

The phone is as slippery as everyone says and with curved edges i never take it out without a death grip on it.  Its more than just slick plastic. that textured back is like wrapping a hockey puck in nylon, and the phone is very light.

The antennas seem to be in the base of the phone.  i can sit in my living room and hold the top of the phone and get 4 bars on a 4g tower.  Then hold around the bottome it will drop to the point that it switches to edge.  Outside this is not an issue so no worries, its just a little odd.

Pros:
1) The cases are good enough to hold a drop from 3 feet.
2) Switch the cases once a week and make your iPhone look new always :-)
3) The water drops mentioned look good.

Cons:
1) The pictures posted on the product page are with iPhone white color.. Mine is a black color. It didn't seem as pretty as shown on the black one. So watch out if you are having a black iPhone.
2) If you have a screen protector on the back and sides of the iPhone, theses cases may not fit in properly. One of my iPhone has a screen protector and I had to push it hard to make it fit.

That said, I think they did a good job this, but not great.  I had a surface combo for a Blackberry (which was the phone I had before the G-Nex), and it was great. It definitely makes the phone feel a bit bigger, but that is because now there is a case on it.

Something that could improve with more usage is I feel as if it gets ""stuck"" when trying to the phone back in the holster. If you try to put the phone in the holster and then slide it down to the bottom before clipping in, it doesn't slide as smoothly as I expected, but it's not like it doesn't slide period.

I debated between this and the Otterbox Commuter; I finally decided on this one.

The case arrived yesterday, and I was able to compare it side-by-side with a Galaxy S3 in an Otterbox Commuter.

Simply put, this case looks, feels, and performs like a cheap knockoff.

Let's start with the silicone layer. It is too big for the S3. If you put just the silicone on, it is floppy and is in constant danger of falling off. It's so loose that any wrong move will make it flop right off the phone. I couldn't even put the phone in my pocket without the silicone falling off. The outer shell is fine, but because the silicone layer is too big, the outer shell doesn't fit well either. It squishes the inner layer so that it gaps, at either the top or the bottom of the phone. The outer layer does not fit against the inner layer, leaving gaps at each corner.

I compared this to the Otterbox Defender. The Defender case fits like a glove. The outer and inner layers fit together perfectly with no gaps. The inner silicone layer fits snugly and is in no danger of falling off. Thus I've decided to return the Incipio case and get an Otterbox instead.

I'm honestly disappointed. This is the quality I would expect from a $2 knockoff from China, not from Incipio. I've returned it, and I'm getting an Otterbox instead.

I've uploaded several photos of the fit issue, so I recommend you take a look at those before buying.",Cheap Otterbox Knockoff,1356048000,8.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UprC6SYZL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pcrBwOj7L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wGS5wkxSL._SY88.jpg']",

However, these things don't hold up to the summer heat.  First the plastic warped, forcing my to glue it back together.  Next the foam friction pads shrunk, so I replaced those with some weather stripping from the hardware store.  Then wife's mounting mechanism popped loose.  The suction cup baked onto the dash mount and had to be cut loose with a utility knife.  If you live a place with hot summers, they you'll need to buy a new one every year as the summer heat destroys them.

Ironically, I'm currently ordering 2 replacements as it looks like they're all made of the same cheap plastic and currently these are the least expensive.

This is designed for phones/tablets/devices that support MHL, which is primarily used to attach these devices to HD TVs.  Since not all TVs support power out through their HDMI ports, the device also comes with a side port for power via USB.  This allows the device to push display to the TV while still charging so it doesn't drain while watching.  Mine also shipped with an additional Micro-B to USB-A cable for the charge port, which was not pictured.

This was tested using an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HTC-EVO-View-4G-Android-Tablet-Sprint/dp/B006BBLU92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HTC EVO View 4G Android Tablet (Sprint)</a>&nbsp;tablet and worked out of the box with no settings needing changed on the device.  It was plugged into a Sony Bravia HX800 which immediately picked up the display output, and mirrored the output on the screen.

In order to know if this will work for you, you need to first make sure your device supports MHL (Just Google for your device and MHL support).  Also, if you are not running stock firmware/ROMs on your device, MHL may not be supported, so make sure to check the distribution support lists.  Otherwise, on stock hardware, this should be automatic.

This is a great way to show media, movies, etc. and control them on screen with your android devices.  I am very pleased with this order, and very glad I didn't spend extra for the ""official"" adapter.",Works out of the box,1325635200,8.0,,

The case is reasonably easy to insert my brand new iPhone 5 into, though I did pull on the material to get my iPhone in there with the least amount of force possible. Once in there, it fits like a glove, and feels very solid. You never know with cases that are on the market before the device is, as all the manufacturers have to work with are the dimensions. Without physically having the device, that can sometimes not work out too well.

Thankfully this is not the case (pun intended). This case really fits nicely, and is quite solid. It's very reminiscent of the Speck PixelSkin HD, so if you liked that case on your iPhone 4/4S (as I did), you'll feel right at home with this.

Thanks for the great case, STM!

I liked the smooth feel of silicone, but those came off really easy. I liked the hard plastic photo cases but they were really slippery and often didn't protect the face of the phone. So when I found this one, I was THRILLED. Just grippy enough, easy to insert and extract from my pocket, not too bulky, etc. But damn if that tiny little piece around the dock connector/charging port didn't break within three months (bought it August 5 and I noticed it was cracked October 27). It may have been cracked before that, but it isn't really obvious unless you are fiddling with that tiny little piece or happen to press down on it where the hairline crack becomes more visible. The rubber strip around the top edge of the case keeps the plastic pretty well together, even when cracked, which is good (as another reviewer said, it won't make your phone fall out or anything). And I'm not hard on my phone--I'm a SAHM who charges her phone throughout the day and puts it in a dock a few times a week while I'm cooking dinner.

4.0,True,2010-01-04,A2UEB48LAWFUCW,B0013A7KMW,,Joseph91,"This is Motorola's phone designed for emerging markets.  A great value for the price, it's a durable, reliable phone, but it doesn't do much else.  I bought this to ride out the last two months in my AT&T contract, and it has worked fine.

I would rate at at 4 stars FOR THIS PRICE POINT.  At the price, my only real complaints are that I would like more characters on the screen and would like better support for handsfree.

Pros:

1) Price:  You will not be able to find an unlocked phone anywhere near this price.  If you did, it wouldn't be nearly as good at what it does.

2) Durability: This phone is tough.  Not many moving parts, no fancy operating system, solid integrated keys.

3) Phone: It makes phone calls well.  The sound is good, the reception is good, the speakerphone is good.  Its alarm and clock functions are fine, its internal phonebook is weak but functional, and it can text in an emergency.

4) Minimalism:  There is a certain sexy minimalism about a sleek black phone that doesn't do *anything* except make phone calls.

Cons:

1) Texting and phonebook are weak.  The phone's display is ""e-ink"", and is limited to 2 lines of 6 characters at a time. (It looks like you are reading a calculator).  If you don't mind scrolling through 12 letters at a time, it's possible to text, but it's not easy.  I wouldn't use this phone to send or receive texts except in an emergency.  Similarly, there is a basic phonebook, but once you store more than a few dozen numbers, it's hard to get much use out of it.

2) Handsfree is limited.  The speakerphone is great.  Unfortunately, without bluetooth, you can't use wireless headsets, and even wireline headsets are hard to find because of the custom combination headphone/power jack.

3) No other features.  No GPS.  No graphics.  No games.  No videos, MP3s, ringtone downloads, camera, or any of the other doodads we take for granted.

Tips:

1) Some people have complained that their phone won't activate touchtone menus.  My phone will activate touch-tone menus, but only in speakerphone mode.  When I'm not in speakerphone, menus won't recognize my tones.

2) The documentation is minimal.  If you google, Motorola has a much better manual available for download, and there are also a number of unpublished programming codes.

Update: According to exhaustive googling, the touch-tone problem can be fixed, temporarily, by pulling the battery for 10 seconds to reset the basic settings.  This has worked for me - from time to time, touch-tone stops working on automated menus.  Pulling the battery and resetting the phone gets it working again, at least for a while.","Basic, functional phone, but little else (plus touch-tone tip)",1262563200,2.0,,

It still charges up and will charge a completely dead iPhone 5 to 100% and still have enough juice for about 60% more in another iPhone 5. This is after a year of almost daily use. When it was new and my girlfriend and I had the iPhone 4, it would charge us both up fully from dead. It is great for snowboarding so you can play your music on your phone all day and run gps tracking apps and facebook and have crappy mountain service all day and still have full battery at the end of the day on your phone to go out and have drinks with! There are many of these on the market now. I would recommend going higher in mAh. This one is 4000, but if I were to buy another one, I would get one that were 8000 or 10000 with 2 USB ports. Mophie makes another one that is bigger. If you need one of these to charge an ipad, consider that the ipad has a 20,000 mAh battery (new iPad). So go HUGE if you think you are charging an iPad with one of these things. It works awesome and charges remarkably FAST. As fast or faster than a wall charger. 2.1 amps.

Initially some of the sparkles would come off in your hand, but that is to be expected.  After a couple of days of use, I haven't noticed any on her, or on my hands when I handle the phone.

I have the Sony iPod Alarm Clock/Dock deal, and it charges in that without having to remove the case.

The only problem I notice on a lot of iPhone cases is that there is usually not enough room left around the earphone jack for a standard RCA Y adapter (3.5mm to RCA).  Usually the neck on the 3.5mm (earphone side) is too large.  You will need to get one where the 3.5mm neck is the size of the earphone plug, or purchase a standard RCA to 3.5mm adapter and a 3.5mm pigtail to plug it into.

I've had 1 service issue with the phone but it was due to two towers having issues in the area that I am in. I have traveled to several states with no problems with service.
I suggest going into the phones Application and adding the widget for the Task Manager that comes with the phone or download one from the market.  The stock one work fairly well. I prefer super box tools more features. Having said that if you don't clean up the phone once a day if your a heavy user of the net, programs and what not. The phone can become bogged down, IE slow. A quick clean up makes the phone back to zippy. I would also suggest turning off the on screen animation, it improves performance
The battery life for my is very acceptable, the web is not rocket fast, but for what it is its pretty quick considering its a so called prepaid phone.
Please note that this phone as with most other prepaid phones does NOT roam, thats why its so cheap. I have also hit my milestone on the ""shrinkage"" plan.
Its a basic entry level andriod phone, and for me and my whole family (we all have  the same phone) we are saving TONS of money with the unlimited 50 plan, then toss in the shrinkage deal and I mean how can you beat it?

Overall Im very satisfied with the phone and the boost service (which is sprint- so if you hate sprint this might not be for you) And to be honest I had sprint a couple of years ago, and could not stand them due to the poor service in the area i was using the phone the most.  Well fast forward and I got to say the service at least in my view has improved tremendously. And this is coming from a guy who bangs up 3000-4000 mins a month.

On the inside there's two credit card sized slots for an ID card of a ""return to address if lost"" tag. And that's about it.

Now with the most important part.  This case, although recommended by Amazon for the Tab 2 7in,  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR  GALAXY TAB 2 7.0 OWNERS! I think it only is compatible for the 1st gen Galaxy Tabs.

The tab doesn't fit correctly; some of the tab is exposed on the left because it doesn't go in all the way. The fabric that holds the tab in doesn't have the correct cut-outs for the Tab 2. The top portion completely covers the mic and headphone jack. The volume button is covered on the upper/high volume portion, thus keeping pressure on the high volume button.  Even though I don't use the Peel app and the IR, it's completely covered as well.  The bottom speakers aren't aligned correctly.

Well if you have your phone in your shirt's LEFT pocket, you can't even use this headset in your RIGHT ear. I kid you not! That's about 16 inches. The audio is completely broken up. And if you put your hand over the phone, the signal is 100% stopped.

Major design flaw, ignore this till they fix it. Stick to the M155 which is a fantastic headset and half the price!

We were about to get them directly from Verizon, but when we saw them here, we ordered them. Despite a brief hiccup in the authorization/shipping area which caused the phones to arrive a few days late, they arrived all shiny and new, and with batteries fairly well charged. We topped them off just in case, then began the set up process to use the phones. It was fast and painless, and enabled us to transfer all of our email accounts. We are both first time smartphone users, and reading our emails on the phones is FABULOUS, especially on these phones! And trust me, having a real (Qwerty) keyboard makes all the difference. Yes, I know a phone can be slightly thinner with only a virtual keyboard, but typing is night and day. We actually can be productive with these phones. They come loaded with many apps, including the all important Microsoft Office (mobile edition), and we can edit Word docs, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. It is as if we suddenly moved from the 20th century to the 21st century.

We also switched over from ATT to Verizon, and this has been night and day. No more dropped calls, no more digital breakup, and all of our data is delivered quickly! So congrats to Motorola for making a FABULOUS phone, and congrats to Verizon for having excellent service. And a final congrats to Amazon.com for working through a small problem and not only making things right, but going above and beyond to help a customer.

However, for me comfort was an issue [the thick earpiece on the Voyager caused pressure on my close-to-my-head ears.] So, I got a Motorola H15. Great comfort with the slim earpice and light weight - horrendous sound quality at both ends. I gave up on bluetooth headsets for one year.

It has a great range: I can leave my phone turned on in the car, go into a store for a few hundred feet, and still be connected. If the connection gets lost, a recorded voice says the headset is disconnected. With compatible phones, it responds to voice commands like ""answer, call ..., etc."" The battery life is unbelievable. Upon each fire up, a voice tells you if the battery power is high, medium, low. They only weakness I've noted: I wish the ear piece held the phone a bit more securely to the ear. That's the only reason I didn't give this a ""five."" I found the ear bud attachment, a provided option, even worse. I have had the headset occasionally fall off. However, even though the phone feels like it's just ""floating in air"" and not firmly attached, the voice quality is still top notch. So, perhaps it's just me.

Lee,"I previously had an iPhone 3G with an invisibleShield screen protector, and my experience with that product was that it was tough as nails and impossible to scratch... but the protector itself was not crystal clear and changed the feel of the touchscreen.  Good, but not perfect.

So when I upgraded my phone, I thought I'd give the PhoneDevil a try since a) it has much better reviews, b) it's cheaper, and c) the reviews indicated that the protector was clearer and smoother than the invisibleShield.

Application was a breeze -- though I wouldn't necessarily say it was easier than the invisibleShield.  With this one, initial application was easier since you didn't have to mess with a spray bottle and the messy liquid.  However, you don't get the ability to adjust it once it's applied since it doesn't slide at all after applying.  So, pros and cons to both application methods.

The protector is indeeed crystal clear and once applied, it maintains the same smoothness and tactile feel as iPhone's touchscreen (unlike the IS).  Unfortunately, the cover got scratched up the first day in my pocket.  I accept some responsibility as I had a quarter and a penny in my pocket with the iPhone -- I didn't pay much attention since I was used to the IS, which is well-nigh indestructible.  So lesson learned for me regarding how scratch proof the PhoneDevil is... not nearly as scratch-proof as the invisibleShield.  I'm trying to decide whether to replace with IS or PhoneDevil or move onto a third brand of screen protector.

EDIT (after about 1 year of use):  I never got around to replacing the screen protector and I just don't understand all of the positive ratings -- they must be from employees of the company.  This thing scratches so easily it's hard to believe people like it so much.  My phone is so scratched up just from normal wear and tear (I've been very careful since the first scratch to keep it in a pocket with nothing else) that at least once a week someone asks me ""what happened to your phone?"".  I've been using PDAs for 15+ years -- from the original palm pilot -- and have never seen a screen protector this easy to scratch.

Installation was fairly simple although it doesn't bend as easy as a protector so you have to be a little gentle.  Far less bubbles than the normal protector.  I only had to get rid of a few small ones at the very bottom (near the button.)  After several hours, they have started to fade away.

The clarity is simply amazing.  I was concerned that the oleophobic coating would hamper the screen image -- but it doesn't.  It's perfectly clear.

I've only had the protector on for half a day so far, but the oleophobic coating seems to be doing its job.  Cleaning the GLAS.tR is just as easy as a normal protector.  I use my jeans and usually in one swipe, it's clean.

So why only 4 stars?

The included colored, puffy buttons are HORRIBLE.  Seriously, if you really want to preserve your phone's image, do NOT use these.  They are cheap and made of basically a sticker with some plastic coverings that will scratch.

Having to remove one AFTER the GLAS.tR is in place is a serious PITA.  Cleaning all of the glue residue off is next to impossible given how thick the GLAS.tR is...

PROBLEM SOLVED!!!!!!!
I replaced the LG800 with a Tracfone Samsung T301G phone.  The T301G is available with Triple Minutes which from my experience is the only good feature feature of the LG800 that actually worked well.  The T301G has better reception and voice quality and does not have the problems that I have described below.  AND is half the price!

The dubious quality of Tracfone service will continue to haunt the provider relationship.

To add insult to injury the battery just died after only 6 months of use.  I have had cell phones where the batteries have lasted for several years.  I normally would not comment about a battery failure, but the product defects just keep piling up.  I suspect that LG's lack of ability or desire to fix the known/substantial LG800 defects reflect badly on corporate policy for support of any LG product. Despite LG's 'Life's Good' slogan, 'Life is Good (even GR8) Without LG.' BUYER BEWARE!

Edited comment August 28, 2012
------------------------------
Changed the two start rating to one star.

I just dread the very idea of using this phone!  The phone continues to have a mind of it's own doing things I did not 'request' and costing me minutes.  Many times the phone rings and no one is there.  A few days ago it just froze up and would not work at all until I removed and replaced the battery.  Why do I need to unlock the phone when the voice mail has just asked me to enter my pin?  I guess it's just another built in seemingly 'small' aggravation that can't be fixed or overridden that makes use difficult when attempting to use the phone with one hand.  Once I use up the minutes, off to another phone and provider.  My suggestion is: Don't bother with this clunker!
-----------------------------

I swiped this comment from another review of this phone.  ""Imprecise touch operation and poor interface design seem to conspire to make this thing do things it shouldn't. Especially when it comes to mis-dialing and either annoying friends or wasting minutes"", clunky.

I like the triple minutes but not much else.  It's too late (packing materials gone, etc), but wish there was a phone with a better interface or even a simple flip phone w/triple minutes that I could replace this phone with.

Marinkovich,"I've had the EVO since it's release and this is the 3rd case I've owned.  Compared to the last two cases (Body Glove hard case and Seidio Innocase) this is by far the best one yet.  I've owned OtterBox brand cases in the past and loved the protection offered.  The Commuter series is a great way to have protection similar to the Defender series (rubber & hard layers), without all the bulk.  Installing the case and included screen protector is fairly simple.  As with any non-liquid screen protectors, make sure the screen is COMPLETELY free of dust and debris.  Otherwise, you'll have indefinite air-bubbles.  Once the protector is on, then comes the silicone based inner shell.  It forms to the phone pretty well, but I kinda wish it was a BIT more snug in areas where material is thinner.  Once that's on, the outer shell is added.  I found it a bit tricky to put on mainly due to the thin rubber on the left and right sides of the inner shell and the USB/HDMI protective flap.  Once the case is on, it feels quite solid.

The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is due to a few things.

-If I have to pull the battery out or change the SD card, the whole case has to come off.  One thing I liked about the Seidio case was the case came off quickly.

-The protective flap for the USB and HDMI ports pops out all the time.  Usually when the phone is pulled out of a pocket.  If there was a ""plug"" similar to the HPJ protective flap, then this would probably reduce the likeliness of this occurring.

-The inner silicone shell could be a bit more snug.  When I'm taking off or putting on the outer hard shell, I feel like I'm going to tear the thinner areas of the inner shell.

-The Kickstand.  With the Body Glove and Seidio case, it was pretty easy to open the kickstand.  Much more difficult with this case.  Also the phone is much more unstable with the kickstand open on it's side.  I feel like any slight movement will cause the phone to fall over when I'm watching a movie or reading a book.

Overall though, I'm quite happy with this case :)",Best of both worlds,1290902400,16.0,,

Ease of use: -1 star

Not so easy to use.  There are no guides or anything to help you place the phone in the dock.  You cannot see the male USB spike to connect it to the female USB receptor on the phone.  Since the phone does not sit flush against the back to the dock, you have left/right and front/back to try and figure out, all the while scratching the bushed metal finish at the bottom of the phone.  All this make the dock no easy to use the just plugging you phone into the USB cord.

After fighting and possibly scratch the Note, the software screen comes up.  It has a nice feature to be used as an alarm clock, but who would want the 5"" screen shining brightly all night long?  It does show the current time, date and temperature.  You can also use the dock as a photo picture frame, play music and a few other nifty function.  So, the dock looses one point for the Alarm Clock function with a bright display.
There is an external jack for head phone/speakers located next to the power input on the back of the dock.

Nope, will not happen.

Price:

I paid almost thirty dollars for this item.  With all the draw backs and lack luster engineering, the dock is maybe work fifteen dollars at the most.

The phone is difficult to place in the dock and almost makes the product worthless.  The dock makes the phone look nice on my desk with my family pictures scrolling through, but the difficulty of getting the phone on the dock (the reason for actually getting the dock) is frustrating at best.  if it wasn't for the fact that i need the Samsung dock to use the built-in app for scrolling pictures and the neat clock function, i would send it back to Amazon.",I really wanted to like it...,1330646400,7.0,,

This is nearly perfect. The case is actually only clear on the side edges and frosted on the back, so you won't see your cover color but from the sides.

Not frosting the case sides also allows it to retain some of the TPU grippy-ness that I like but I wish that they'd chosen to not frost the back and allow the natural color of the back to show through.

The cut-outs for the top and bottom microphones are each a touch off center--not enough to block them, but enough to make me wonder if the sound will be muffled or diminished, since they are not centered on the cut-outs.

The headphone jack cut-out is OK but not perfect as well. A standard headphone with a straight, tapered, housing will fit, but an angled one with a thick housing was not a fit without stretching the cutout hole away from the plug (not easy).

5.0,True,2012-03-24,A4EKVQER3YGZC,B006QURCB8,{'Color:': ' White'},Lovethefuture,"To be clear, this is a review for the Elago Breathe S4 2 case. If you look online (or for video reviews) you will most likely come across the original Elago S4 Breathe case. This is an updated version that Elago has brought to the market very recently. The differences between this updated S4 case and the original are subtle but important. The original S4 case has a silver plate logo on the back, a 'lip' around the front of the case that semi-protects the front of the iPhone if you lay it on a flat surface, and sports sharper edges. The updated S4 (The S4 2) has a more subtle logo on the back that essentially disappears within the case, the edges are more rounded, and there is no longer a 'lip' which means you will have no protection from the surface itself when your iPhone is face-down on a table, etc.

I opted for the updated model, and I'm glad I did. All the edges are rounded and give off an more streamlined look and feel compared to the original model. The fact that there is no 'lip' doesn't bother me one bit. I'm not really someone who puts their iPhone face-first on a surface when it's out of my pocket. The hard plastic provides a nice grip. I certainly feel it makes the iPhone less slippery compared to when it has no case. This case however provides no protection if you were to drop your iPhone and have it land face-first. It's really a case meant for people who want something that will cover the back of the iPhone and provide a better gripping experience. If you want or need serious protection, I recommend an Otterbox case or something from Incipio and the like.

Ideally this case is for people who hate using a case in general. The iPhone 4/4S is a seriously slim smartphone and this case is perfect for people who want a little protection but need to or want to keep their iPhone's slim in appearance and feel. Despite the fact that I now have almost a dozen iPhone 4 cases, and the others ones provide more protection, I'll probably opt for this case every day because it looks and feels awesome.","If You Hate Cases, This One's For You",1332547200,8.0,,

I pride myself in terms of battery knowledge, as I race 1/10th-scale Professional Cars and Trucks in NORRCA and ROAR-sanctioned events, both on road and off-road type vehicles with ""05-scale"" electric motors, using specially made Li-Ion Sub-C Cells that are proprietary for hobbyists and racers, and it takes a bit of ""battery science and knowledge"" to be successful in racing, so I've become a bit of an expert over the years (racing professionally since 1987).

We first started racing with NiCad batteries, which preceded Li-Ion Cells, and there was a vast array of equipment out to deal with NiCad batteries as they have a ""memory effect"" and need to be specifically and specially charged and discharged in certain ways both to get high voltage out of them, and for reliability and long-life concerns. With the advent of Li-Ion Sub-C Racing Cells we threw out the book on NiCads, and began the modern era of Li-Ion Sub-C Cells racing and a whole new ""science"" of getting the most out of the new cells in terms of voltage and high run time, because to race and win your cells have to be the best, both in voltage and run time. We also use NiMH batteries in racing, but principally Li-Ion for the high-end racing like I do.

With respect to ""battery science"" the Eneloop Cells are a bit of an enigma, but a little research gets you some knowledge, and I discovered that the Eneloop Cells are NiMH (Nickle metal-hydride) cells, which are not as efficient as Li-Ion cells, while they offer the benefits of ""no memory effect"" of Li-Ion Cells and the ease of charging with a variety of types of chargers, both for ease of use and fast/slow charge techniques. In addition the Eneloop Cells tend to be made in Japan, which bodes for higher quality cells than Chinese cells (in general people believe this to be a fact when it is not), or so a lot of people think and believe.

The Sanyo Eneloop AA Cells are 2000mAh cells, but they seem to be very efficient and give long run time in a variety of products ranging from cameras to pen lights to RC receiver packs (where I started using them), and a specialty use that I also found to give amazing life is using these cells in my pro flash unit for a DSLR Pentax K10D camera, a ""Metz Meccablitz"" flash unit which has been very ""energy hungry"" with respect to batteries in general...but enter the Sanyo Eneloop cells, and surprise! I have found that a 4-pack of Eneloop Cells can last for up to 150 flashes in the Meccablitz flash unit, a surprising number of flashes because this is a full-featured flash unit with a very advanced bulb system which takes a modicum of power to operate it. In addition I can leave a set of Eneloops IN the flash unit and they didn't degrade over time like traditional rechargeable batteries, which is a most commendable feature to say the least.

My wife's DSLR camera is a Pentax *ist DS, (a hand-me-down from my own uses) one of the 1st Pentax Digital SLR cameras, and it uses a four-pack of AA batteries for a power source. We have found the same thing to be true in it: we can store the camera with a 4-pack of Sanyo Eneloops for extended periods of time without penalty, ie the cells do not degrade much (perhaps 10% at most) while IN the camera, and you can enjoy full use out of a set without regard to having to remove/replace them during periods of non-use...and that set will yield an amazing number of shots in the camera also, perhaps as many as two times (2X) the yield of so-called ""high powered"" NiMH cells with mAh ratings as high as 2800mAh to 3000mAh, with the added benefit of non-degrading while IN the camera.

As for the AAA Eneloop Cells, they are rated at 800mAh and we find the same features in those cells as have the 2000mAh AA cells: they not only last longer than traditional NiMH cells, and have no memory effect to speak of either, but they also don't require removal during use to prolong their long cycle life. I am using one of the AAA cells in my powered Gillette razor with amazing benefits, as it seems to last for about 25+ shaves, and then I can simply recharge it and use it again, which beats the heck out of constantly replacing Alkaline cells with my razor system, a very annoying thing to have to be doing over and over again.

This ""kit"" called the ""CostCo"" kit has the 8 AA cells, 2 (two) AAA cells, the charger and the C-sized and D-sized ""adapters"" which allow you to use AA cells in place of C and D batteries, and the D-sized adapters are very useful while the C-sized adapters are sitting idle without ever being used yet...I just don't have many C-size batteries in the house or my work, but plenty of D-size batteries are used in flashlights and backup for radios and the like, so they do get used. As for the charger? I find it's very slow, and it only charges in pairs effectively, so within reason it is useful, but I have purchased a La Crosse Technology battery charger for my NiMH use, and also use an Energizer Quick Charger (one hour max time, 15-20 minute recharge time for a 2500mAh NiMh cell of any type, a very, very fast charger!) for the Eneloop batteries with good success.

For the $$$ this CostCo Kit is a good buy, and I can see where people buying into the Eneloop system would purchase the kit as a 1st step in their ownership of the Eneloop batteries and system, but of course buying the cells in specific sizes makes more sense once you get going with Eneloop batteries in all your NiMH battery uses. The kit does provide a charger and a good selection of the Eneloop batteries, and certainly it's a place to start. However I would recommend that people invest in a proper charger or two for extended use--ie waiting for hours and hours for the Sanyo Eneloop Charger to function is not in the cards for most people!

Overall the Eneloop batteries are a great new system that people are adopting vs standard NiMh batteries, as the cells are the only ones currently available that retain their charge over time and also have the added benefit of not having to remove them in their appliances and controllers, toys and the like during periods of non-use, a most amazing benefit and one that everybody appreciates who uses the cells. I like the 5-year Sanyo Warranty on Eneloop batteries also, as that shows that the company stands behind their product and offers the consumer a nice guarantee against failures and defective cells, which I have yet to find in my Eneloop cells. I have purchased about 20 of the Eneloop cells in AA and AAA sizes so far, and have been replacing all of my other NiMH cells with the Eneloop cells as time has gone on.

Frankly I cannot see that there is any need for traditional NiMH batteries and that the Eneloop brand will be a fantastic replacement product for standard NiMH cells. The product promises a lot and delivers a punch to standard NiMH cells that they won't soon be recovering from. This package of cells and accessories, the ""CostCo"" Kit is a good value with all the standard fare included to start people out on the Eneloop system including an assortment of cells, battery charger and the handy C and D size adapters. I'm giving the kit five stars for value, performance and persistency, and highly recommend it to Amazon.com buyers in the market for an alternative to standard rechargeable cells.

It is the BEST case to purchase for the money if you want to protect your valuable electronics.  I first purchased the Defender case and boy will it PROTECT your phone!!!  If you are hard on your cell phone, the Defender case is the case to get.  If you are more gentle than the Commuter case with be fine.  I will go over both the Defender case as well as the Commuter case with you.

The Defender case is basically comprised of two hard pastic casings that you put one on the front of the phone and one on the back of the phone.  The front casing has a hard plastic cover that protects the entire phone screen.  You push these two casings together to close the hard casing aspect of the case and then stretch a rubber covering around the entire phone, except for the front of it. lol  The rubber overlay covers the entire back of the phone as well as the edges of the phone.  The rubber covering never moves.  I have dropped my phone on ceramic tile with this defender case on and it was perfectly fine when I picked it up.  It was like nothing even happened to it.  : )  There is no doubt that your phone will be totally protected if you use the Defender case.

With that said, my phone was starting to feel pretty bulky with all of this protection but I did not want to jeopardize my phone by not using it. That is when I started searching to see if Otterbox had any other options for my Droid Incredible.  When I found the Commuter case I liked that it was thinner than the Defender but was wondering if it would be just as good.  Well it is but in different ways.  Here is a couple of differences tht I found.

1) Defender is thicker than the commuter case.
2) Defender has rubber outer case while Commuter has rubber as the first layer and a hard case on top of the rubber. This means if you drop your phone with the Commuter case on concrete you are probably going to have some gouges in the hard plastic where with the Defender case, the rubber is the outer covering so you probably wouldn't notice anything if phone is dropped.
3)  Commuter case outer covering is hard plastic which can be more slippery in the hand than the rubber outer covering of the Defender case.
3) Defender case rolls over the edge of the phone screen a tiny bit where you might have to zoom in a bit to get to words or game aspects that are right along the edges of the phone.  This got annoying to me sometimes. This is not happening with the Commuter case.
4)  The rubber plugs on the Commuter case are difficult to pull out. This is because you have to dig in between the hard case on the outer edge and the phone itself to pull the plugs out.  With the Defender case, the rubber covering was on the outside so the rubber plugs were more easily accessible and definitely easier to pull out.
5) There is no holder for the Commuter case where the Defender case comes with a great, sturdy rotating clip attachment so that you can just clip the phone to your waistband or pocketbook.  I am disappointed that there is no clip with this case.
6)  No too thriled with the screen protector that came with the case and I will probably buy a different screen protector on Amazon.
7)The Defender case not only has a plastic screen protector covering the front screen but also a plastic screen covering the camera lens.  It is great that the camera lens is protected but the plastic covering can cause your photos to be diminished.

I love both cases and will use both as needed.  If I feel I need more protection such as if I am going on a trip or will be around kids, like family holidays  lol  I will put the Defender on.  For day to day use I am glad I got the Commuter case.  Like I said earlier, Otterbox cases are  the best in the business and everyone should have one to protect their precious electronics. : ) I am glad I have both and that I can interchange between the two casses as need be.

2nd batch...one came with a bubble already in it, the second one was sort of ok, very bottom around the edges the adhesive was not very good and leaves what looks like an elongated air bubbles but it's just not sticking very well to the phone so not getting a good seal. Not going to press my luck and put the 3rd one on, it could turn out worse and I'll have no screen protector. I will use this one until I buy JLG (Just Like Glass) screen protectors. They are twice as expensive though over $13.00 plus shipping, but supposedly no drag on the S Pen.

If you have to lift the screen protector to adjust it after lifting up the 1st tab...it's over, you'll get air bubbles and they won't all dissipate after pressing down on them and moving them to the edge, you will have to throw it away.

They sent me a second batch and gave me my refund even though I did not ask to be sent a new batch. I told them I will be looking for a better screen protector specifically made for phones with a stylus or S Pen.

For other users, it might be a great solution, but I have to review it vis-a-vis my phone, the HTC Evo 4G. If you are not familiar with it, the Evo is a large phone. However, it is relatively light so I had high hopes that it would work. It didn't.

First of all, the back of the Evo is slightly pourous in nature, making the Clingo complpetely unable to adhere to the phone for more than a minute or two. Second, when I put a case on the phone (plastic HTC case), it worked better but was not a full-proof adherence. Sometimes it would stay in place for the whole trip, other times it would fall off quickly. The Evo is simply too big.

Finally, in addition to falling off, the large size of the Evo caused the ball joint at the end to droop. The articulating arm has a screw in lock but the ball joint at the end is free-floating. As such, it was easy for the phone to point down, expecially if I hit a bump.

The Clingo is probably a great solution for an iPhone user and many other phones...it just doesn't work for the HTC Evo 4G, much to my shagrin. Some may say, then, that it is the phone that is the problem. You are right.

3.0,True,2012-09-20,A6SO1CY6VID67,B007BQDSIM,,MT,"Pros:
1. They didn't stick me with yet another vehicle charger for my phone. I have roughly a dozen various chargers Motorola products in my house. I don't need more.

2. The phone holder portion of this thing is completely perfect. No joke. The Maxx fits like a glove, the bit that connects the charger is a snap and smooth as can be. Launches your car dock programs (I have a third part app that I prefer over the stock, but whatever you prefer, it launches it). Snaps out easily and both snap in and snap out are one-handed operations. It is, basically, perfect for the phone.

Neither pros nor cons:
1. Comes with an aux cable. I can rarely find one when I need one, but I also don't have an aux port in my car, so I'll probably lose this one promptly.

2. No, it will not work with your case. Of any kind. I don't use cases, so I don't care, but if you use a case, it won't fit.

Cons:
1. The arm. It's about four inches long and does not have any pivot points. So no matter where you mount it, it will be four inches away from the surface. This is completely unacceptable in my car. Mounting on the windshield puts it so far away from me that it's useless; mounting it on the dash makes it hover in my sightline. I can't put it on the left side of the steering wheel because a) I don't want to, and b) the charger doesn't reach that far. I had the Motorola dock for my Droid X previously, which was great because it had a pivot point in the arm in addition to the rotation of the plate that the phone hooked into. If this had that, it would be made of perfection. But it doesn't. So it's not.

2. Arguably a negative point, but the connection between the arm and the phone plate is a ball and socket, which is cool and all, but since I love the phone plate and hate the arm, the plate connection (socket) is compatible with absolutely no other mount in the history of time. So, I'm stuck with a phone plate that's made of magic and arm that can go suck an egg. I'm torn between scrapping the whole thing and getting a much more expensive third part mount that I might hate less but won't get in my way while driving.

If you sit up WAY HIGH in your car and don't need the bottom four inches of visibility above your dash, or if you windshield is such that mounting to your windshield will work, then go on, this thing is perfect for you. But for me, in my car, no dice. It's not as versatile as previous Motorola docks are, and I wish I'd known that before I bought it. Que sera.

Update 02/05/13: This is actually old news for me, but might be helpful for others. I was able to find an online store that sells custom car mounts. From them, I purchased a vent bracket that's made for my car, as well and a ball mount to attached to the vent bracket. End result is a base that sits at a reasonably height that I can use the phone plate from Motorola on, thus making my set up kind of perfect. Additionally, the top of the vent bracket is a great place for that bluetooth microphone that I don't want to have to run all the way up to the roof of my car.","The phone holder is GREAT, the arm.... not so much.

I ordered the smoke / translucent and that is what it is. It does have one flaw in my opinion.  All of the cut outs for the buttons, plugs, camera, etc are just that - neat holes cut out of the plastic. All of them except one.  The power button cut out isn't cut out at all.  It's slightly recessed into the case and although it has a slightly different texture that the surrounding plastic, I find it difficult to locate the power button easily by touch alone.

I have had the case a few days and thought it might just take some time, and maybe if I wait longer it may become easier to find.  If that was the only problem with it I would have a little more patience.  However because of the design, the INSIDE of the recess for the power button does not make contact with the actual button.  When I do finally locate the power button part of the case, it take extra pressure to overcome the gap between the case and the power button.

In researching other cases, they nearly all indicate that every access is cut out and when zooming into picture detail I can clearly see power the button directly exposed.  As I said, this is close but not good enough for me, especially since there are many other cases available.

I'd like to add to KD Wright's comments and I agree.  The picture of the case doesn't even come close to the large, silverized JKase logo on the case.  While you can see it in some of the extra pictures, it is generally very light and in some pictures, especially the main picture, I'd say it was airbrushed to minimize it's appearance on Amazon (you can just barely see it in the picture but can't miss it when you get the case. That's just not honest.  On any case, especially for a high end device like the Note 2, having a goofy logo really is an annoyance.

The most important thing for something in this price range is the size.
It's not the slimmest, but then the slimmest would provide no protection.
So this is a good trade-off - there is a slim inner lining to protect the back side from short drops.
It goes on and off tightly - you'd have to push/yank it pretty hard most times.
the bottom is practical if you have certain plug-ins that are not case-friendly.

The Infuse dimensions are:
5.1"" tall
2.7"" wide
.38"" thick

And I can confirm that the infuse fits inside this case - albeit barely.  There is a slit in the back of the case which you will slide your phone in.  Ideally you would be able to fit your phone in with the slit shut, but you'll be able to get a little more room by stretching the case slightly so that the slit opens.  The Infuse fits inside this case with the slit about 1/2"" open.  This means that it fits inside this case with a little ""stretch"" - which is fine by me.  The case is snug and feels very secure.  I have no worries about the phone wobbling loose while I jog.

The plastic cover on the case allows you to operate the touch screen on your phone, though you have to press harder than you would normally.  This is cumbersome while you're exercising (moreover jogging), so I would advise minimal phone manipulation while it's in the case.  The back of the case is a neoprene type material, which is fairly porous.  If you get super sweaty while exercising, there is a possibility for moisture to get in through the back of this case.  This would seem to only be an issue for profuse sweating over long periods of time.

I did, however, cut off the tag that is on the inside top of the holster, concerned that eventually it might abrade the screen.  I planned to follow the suggestions in other reviews to not use the metal clip.  However, when the holster arrived, I found that the image submitted by N. Peelman of how to re-position the clip properly resulted in a very secure fit that I could not make slip off despite much effort.

Update 11/21/12: After a few months of usage, I've had absolutely no problems with this holster.  In the past I've avoided cases with spring metal clips like the plague, instead opting for those with plastic clips.  My concern with the spring metal clips was that, without the distinct bottom ""hook"" that the plastic clips usually have, cases with simple metal clips (including those covered in vinyl or leather) would too easily slip off of my belt.  Then again, the plastic clips are far from perfect, since they do have a tendency to break.  Maxpedition's metal clip, on the other hand, is the best solution... it's not going to break, and because of its design, it does not readily come off of the belt without deliberately doing so.  But just to emphasize, you MUST reposition the clip on the holster's loops as previously mentioned... without this adjustment, the case will almost certainly slide right off of the metal clip (leaving the metal clip hooked to your belt, but your phone/holster on the ground).  Upped to 5 stars.

Update 9/11/14: A few years later, and this holster is still working out perfectly.  Not even once has it slipped off my belt, and I've even sideswiped it while walking through doorways quite a few times.  It's not showing any signs of wear either.

Update 9/17/16: I recently upgraded to the iPhone 6s (4.7""), and though the specs would indicate that this holster is too small, it does actually still work satisfactorily.

Lets face it as a young dutch man straight out of college (read cheap/frugal, cares about his technological appeal, and on a budget) So in short I wanted to protect my cell phone for pennies on the dollar. My quite reasonable expectations for this product were as follows.

1) Cheap (I am dutch/frugal so its important)
  The only requirement that the product passed my expectations.

PASS

2) Protect my cellphone screen
  Even when I got it on correctly (see expectation #5) the protector is easily removed and even more easily scratched. In fact this protector is so soft that a clean fingernail will scratch it. Which mean any object in the world that you can't dent or scratch with your nail is too tough for you to set your phone on. So unless your life is filled with terrycloth and sunbeams your phone will quickly look like you threw it down on the pavement every 5 minutes.

3) Protect my Wife's whole cellphone screen
  Just like every decent man in the first world my wife's phone is better than mine. Her phone is a new i-Phone and boy does it shine. However this means I have TWO sides I need to protect with this product. I saw in the picture that an I pod touch was shown as an item that this product could protect. However this product is WAY too small for the i-phone 4 which is nearly the same size as an I-pod touch. So I'll call false advertising on this one.

FAIL

4) Be able to pretend that its not there (ie not obviously present at a quick glance.)

My fingernail scratches it. In other words, common objects (keys, credit cards, pens, pencils, even tissue paper ect...) in the real world will WTFPWN your screen. Making the rare decent application at risk of looking like that CD that has been kicking around in your trunk for 8 years... Seriously. Also the product smudges so easily that the smudges have smudges, I literally had whole armies of smudges constantly battling on my screen.

FAIL

5) Easily applied.

After about four different attempts (4 out of 10 sheets in the package used an gone forever) at application under uncommonly clean kitchen conditions I got a result that I might nearly pass at first glance. However, after a few minutes the bubbles I worked so hard during application to keep out appeared under the protector spontaneously. So I can't conclusively prove yet suspect this occurred from poor quality control at the manufacturer as the many of the plastic protectors are warped and NOT flat.

FAIL

Conclusion: Don't buy ever. Please for me, yourself, and for everyone else in the world don't buy this product. We must show that consumers are not idiots and that we can learn other peoples mistakes. I spent the time writing this review so you could make my mistake count lady's and gentlemen.

The price was much better than the Samsung battery with what appears to be the same quality. I have charged the battery over a dozen times without any problem. The vendor LaptopMate shipped the battery quickly and it arrived faster than expected. I would suggest the company and the battery to anyone with a Samsung S smartphone. I would purchase from LaptopMate again and recommend them to a friend. Here is a link to the battery.

FYI: Be careful scratching card as not to peel off code sticker. I almost made this mistake where I have read others actually peeled off a (important) code number.

PLEASE NOTE: The following is for ""dramatic"" purposes only...

I've been using Tracfone for over 5 years now and never had any serious problems...okay a dropped call or two, but not recently.

I did need to call Tracfone this time only because I changed phones from a Motorola (basic cell phone) to a LG Internet capable phone. I did receive the ""hold"" message saying it would be approximately 5 minutes where it was only about 2-3 minutes. The representative was very helpful and quickly transferred my remaining minutes and added my new (this card) minutes and 1 year service. As a valued customer, Tracfone also added an additional 250 minutes and 2 more months service. In total, I received an added 1050 minutes (with my double minutes for life) and 14 months of service. The representative also went through all my various questions about the features of my new phone. Over the years, I have had very good customer service for the few times I actually needed to call.

I included the above comments only to describe my experience with Tracfone for those who may be interested.

The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.
Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!
Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!
The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!
At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!

Adquir&iacute; este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pas&eacute; de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tama&ntilde;o del telefono sin ser peque&ntilde;o, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.
Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!
Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Costa Rica). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!
La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!

3.0,True,2012-01-04,AOTJSFCTHKF20,B005OTKTMQ,,Hunt N. Peck,"I put this protector on my Galaxy Nexus.  I carefully followed directions, saturated my fingers with the provided solution, and wet the back of the protector (not excessively). I applied the protector to the phone, slide it into place and then sqeegeed out the fluid and bubbles from the center out to the edges while quickly dabbing the excess fluid with a paper towel.  I then let the phone sit for 24 hours before powering up.

The good:
- the protector covers the entire glass surface and thus affords maximum protection to the screen;
- 99% of the bubbles and imperfections just squeegeed out, the balance disappeared after 24 hours; and
- the cost of this protector is very good in comparison to the competition.

The bad:
- installation is more complicated than experienced with the typical dry application protector;
- I had some fear that the excess solution I squeegeed out from under the protector had found its way into the phone's guts and shorted out my new expensive toy.  It hadn't, thankfully, but water and electronics don't mix well so there is some risk in using a product like this;
- the protector never became ""crystal"" clear like a typical dry protector.  Rather, it had a wavey look to it under certain light conditions;
- worst of all, when I reinstalled my gell case, the edges of the case lifted the edges of the protector and ruined the effect and utility of the product.  That's not the fault of the Skinomi product, but is an issue that you need to consider  when deciding on the the kind of protector that you want on your screen and the case that you use to protect the rest of the phone.  The dry application protectors that I bought from Verizon don't cover the entire screen and thus don't have this problem because the edge of the gell case rests against the glass, not the protector.  So, depending on the kind of case that you have, this protector may not be your best bet. The irony here is that a major advantage offered by this protector of covering the entire glass surface turned out to be its undoing; and
- finally, surrendering my phone for 24 hours while the solution dried was a tough sacrifice to make.

Frankly, I don't see that the good outweighs the bad.  The clear protectors sold by Verizon go on in 2 minutes with no bubbles or imperfections (if applied properly), provide adequate protection, work well with gell cases that wrap around the edge of the glass, are crystal clear, and require no down time.  They may cost a few bucks more, but their cost is insignificant in comparison to the value of the device.  I'm not aware of any claim made by the manufacturer that these protectors offer  superior protection to the dry application protectors (aside from covering the entire screen).

There was no sign of use on the gold contacts, which was a good sign, so I put it in my phone and... nothing happened.  Figured it was discharged completely, so I plugged in my phone to charge it... and nothing happened (at first).  Got a little concerned, so I left it alone for about 10 minutes, came back, and the phone had restarted and the new battery was charging correctly.  Left it on the charger about 2 hours past 100% charge to ""top it off"" and used the phone normally the rest of the day.  Battery power depleted as expected and at the same rate as the original.  Charged it back up to %100 that evening, and haven't had a problem with it since.

Just give it a few minutes if you experience the same thing when initially installing the battery in your phone.  Mine came drained of power completely and I had to give it just a bit on the charger to wake up.  No worries.

What you won't see in the description of the product is that it has a matte finish. This creates a weird glare on the screen, so much so that I'd hate to take it out on a sunny day. And It also softens and adds a weird micro-graininess to the screen quality a bit. If you bought this it's because you bought a phone with a 720p SAMOLED screen. I don't know who in their right mind puts out a product that makes the images on the screen duller. ""Wow, that picture is TOO nice... we need to fix that!"" ... Yeah... I don't get it.

It really is kind of sad when you see the beautiful gloss of the Piano Black screen peaking through around the speaker grill and camera cutout. There was a time I thought that the nice matte finish screen protector which my friend had on his iPhone would've been totally cool to have. That time is well past.

As for the quality itself, it isn't bad. As with all static-cling screen protectors, dust in the air is your enemy. Tip: Turn off your A/C, fans, etc.... practice slow breathing, but the most helpful item in your arsenal: a can of compressed air. Also, practice the placement before your first real attempt. Luckily you get three tries here, I did it in 2. If you mess up your first one, don't throw it away immediately, take the opportunity to figure out what the perfect placement is with the now-doomed protector. Finally, one thing I've learned: If you get it down where it's pretty nice but needs a slight tweak? Quit while you're ahead, you'll never get one of these things down perfectly.

It's thin so protection from drops is limited (still better than nothing or even a Zagg type plastic adhesive) but protection from scratches is excellent.

From Facebook and the comments here (Rearth responded to my questions quickly), you should know that the SF is different from the LF:
SF = Soft feeling = rubberized coating, same as the well reviewed and similarly described&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SF-Matte-Black-Samsung-Galaxy-S3-Rearth-Ringke-Soft-Feeling-Case/dp/B00886BJI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SF Matte Black Samsung Galaxy S3 Rearth Ringke Soft Feeling Case</a>
vs.
LF = Light feeling = plastic with texture for grip but no rubberized coating (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/also-sold-on-Amazon-here/dp/B00993E7RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">also sold on Amazon here</a>).

I've hard other rubber coated cases (like this SF model), which I prefer for grip and the matte look (which I think matches the iPhone 5 case rear section, which is non-glossy, though not necessarily ""matte,"" aluminum). However, I understand some people prefer the easier to remove from your pocket non-rubber coated models like the LF (I do hate when my pocket get turned out as a rubber edge catches the fabric of the pocket, though you learn to accommodate that quickly). Also, the rubber coating on some cases I've owned has rubbed off at the corners, hopefully this case rubber coating will be a bit more durable, but for 10 bucks it's hard to go wrong.

There is a very slight ""lip"" so you can put the phone down with the screen side on a table but the lip keeps the glass *just* off the surface. With a adhesive screen protector it might be exactly on the same level as the lip; it's very thin which I prefer. The InCase snap on case for the iPhone 4 has too high a lip for me, but this lip is just right for limited protection while maintaining the form of the phone.

This plus a decent adhesive cover over the glass front is exactly the size and degree of protection I want. It keeps he phone about the same size (it's surprisingly small/thin/light) while giving decent protection to the corners and back side of the phone. My co-worker didn't even think there was a case on it because it was still thinner than his ""naked"" iPhone 4S. While I hope competition drives the prices down, the quality of the case is excellent even at the current price. If I had to choose a replacement, I'd buy the same case again without regret.

[Update upon receipt:]
The SF soft feeling matte black is excellent: not very grippy at all but enough to keep it from sliding around on my car's dashboard or on my desk. I was able to scrape off the white text on the back without removing the rubber coating so I suspect it will be quite resistant to rubbing off at the corners of the case. The fit is excellent but not perfect (I suspect it will get pretty dang close to perfect after warming up a few times in my pocket, the plastic is hard but somewhat malleable with heat I expect). The feeling is a bit less grip than a similar snap on InCase case; honestly in my subjective opinion it's just right. Enough to stay in place even when the surfaces are not flat but not so much that it pulls the pocket out of my pants when I take the phone out. Less grip than the rubber surrounds on the Apple Bumper protectors, but with more protection over the back of the case.

** The case comes with a slicker on the portion facing the back side of the phone; I was not certain that this should be removed but I found the fit to be better without the sticker and I don't think it provides any additional protection. I'd try your case with the sticker first and if you need a little more room to get the edges to ""snap"" into place, remove the sticker. If your case is too loose, the sticker may improve the fit. However, my case was just right without the sticker and I suspect others will be manufactured to the same specs so forego the sticker.","Simple snap on case, good price, rubber coating so less slipping",1347840000,277.0,,

This cutter makes a pretty rough ""cut.""  It's basically forcing the big SIM card through a small hole which snaps the plastic rather than actually cutting it.  It did work, however, you will need additional tools to smooth the rough edges of the card. We used a finger nail file and nail clippers to snip off the roughness and carefully smooth the edges.  We had several old SIM cards so we were able to practice before using it on a live SIM.  The first try we did not smooth the edges enough and the card actually got stuck in my iPhone 4 - we couldn't get the tiny SIM drawer back out. My husband (an engineer) was finally able to get it out.  So, when we ""cut"" the live card we very carefully worked on the edges to make sure they were VERY smooth on every side and that worked quite well.  Working with the plastic was rather like working on your finger nails.  The card then came in and out of the iPhone very smoothly and, most importantly, it worked in the phone.

There is a window in the bottom of the cutter so you can see if the metal part of the chip is lined up inside the window, you don't want to cut the metal, but it was pretty easy to do it right. If you will be traveling, make sure you also have some tools that you can use to smooth the edges so the card won't get jammed in the phone.

An adaptor was included with the cutter so you can make a micro SIM work in a regular size slot. The adaptor worked very well and allowed me to use my micro SIM in an older phone. Buying this cutter made it possible for my son and I to switch phones, even though they used different sized SIMS.  He's taking the cutter with him in his travels where he expects he will only be able to buy standard sized SIMS which he will cut to fit his (unlocked) iPhone 4. Fortunately, a standard manicure kit provides all the additional tools needed to finish the job!

I gave 4 stars because, though it did successfully cut the card down to the correct size, it leaves such rough edges that the cut cards will not be able to be used in an iPhone without additional work.",Works fine,1348099200,6.0,,

However, the case I received does not fit the LG800g with the gel skin on.  It will fit my LG800g without the gel skin.  With the gel skin on, the magnetic flap will not close.

The case I received actually has a sticker on it stating it is for the LG Rumor.  The disposable foam insert inside the case had these dimensions: 4 1/4"" x 2"" x 3/4"".  So these are the approximate interior dimensions of the case, for anyone wondering if their phone will fit.  Also, small detail, but the case I received is all black, which differs from the two tone black/brown image shown.

I like that this case is a horizontal design.  The flap is held closed by a magnetic catch, so it's easy to open and close to retrieve or store your phone.  The case has two belt loops on the back, as well as a belt hook, so there are a couple ways to wear it.  It has a soft leather-like feel to the outside, while the interior is covered with felt to prevent scratches to your phone.  Despite the soft exterior feel, the case has a rigid design so it will keep its shape.

Overall, I like the design and quality of the case, and the price is excellent, but it is just not useful to me with my LG800g with gel skin.

***** UPDATE: *****
After several days of stretching and forcing the flap closed around my phone, I can now use this case with my LG800g with gel skin.  Sort of.  It just barely fits and the magnetic flap just barely closes (sometimes it will still pop open).  I am going to keep stretching and forcing it to fit around my phone for the hope of a better fit.  But my original opinion still stands: if you purchase this case for the LG800g, be aware that it won't fit at first, but after some forcing and stretching you can indeed make it fit.

5.0,True,2011-08-11,AE9RS4PCACVT0,B0046LTU9G,{'Color:': ' Silver'},Andy H.,"The Nokia E7 is probably the most beautifully designed phone, ever. Everything about its physical appearance simply oozes quality and class, with its smooth lines and curves and the 4-inch Gorilla Glass display. The full QWERTY keyboard hides under the beautiful, bright amoled display, and is revealed by pushing the display into a useful viewing angle. The display moves up into position elegantly and smoothly, not in a stiff, clunky way some other phones might. The Clear Black Display technology that Nokia built into the screen offers up really deep blacks and vivid, bright colors. One can easily use it in bright sunlight. The whole device really is a thing of beauty, and you can fully appreciate how much effort the Nokia designers and engineers put into this phone.

CAMERA:  The E7 comes with an 8MP camera that is capable of shooting 720p HD video, although its EDoF (Extended Depth of Field) camera does not, unfortunately, allow good close up photos. Macro is out. But high quality photos, especially outdoors, are most definitely in. There are some good photo and video editors built-in as well.

HDMI:  By connecting the included HDMI adaptor to your own HDMI cable to your HD TV, you can watch videos (or anything else) from your E7 on your TV. Amazing.

USB and MEMORY:  By connecting the included USB adaptor to your USB stick, you can transfer files to and from the E7 to the USB drive. This is a really useful option and allows you to store huge files (such as movies for that long train ride) outside of the phone to keep it quick and snappy. The E7 does come with 16GB of built-in storage. That may not sound enormous, but I have 250 songs loaded on from iTunes via my Mac, a season of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and the History Channel's 'The Presidents' and around 2 dozen photos which I haven't transfered to my Mac yet. I still have 11GB free on the E7, so I'm not concerned that it doesn't have a slot for a MicroSD card - I wouldn't use it. It's all about space really. In order to have a whole season of TV shows on there, each episode needs to be reduced in size - remember a 4"" screen is a lot smaller than your 56"" plasma TV! Having files that are the same size as the originals is just silly. So you get some free software and transcode those movies and shows to fit the device your using it for. Simple really. Just common sense.

KEYBOARD:  The keys are perfect in shape and spacing, and it is an utter pleasure to type on the E7's keyboard. Yes, you do have the option to use the on-screen keyboard; if Swype is your thing, download it for free and go for it. 99% of things you type out (SMS, emails, documents, etc) would be most likely be done on the keyboard easiest, so you'd be silly not to utilise it. It is without doubt the best keyboard I've ever used on a phone.

NOKIA MAPS:  Nokia is soon to ditch the ""Ovi"" brand and focus on Nokia being Nokia, which seems to make more sense to me. The Maps software is as excellent as it always was, but the newer versions are more accurate, easier to use, and a fantastic free addition to the E7's capabilities. Voice turn-by-turn is great, but more useful is the fact that once downloaded, you can use the maps to navigate OFFLINE. Going abroad? Use Maps without using data. For free. You won't find that in many other devices! Finding your way, either on foot or by car, is an absolute pleasure using Nokia maps. A brilliant piece of software.

APPS:  Out of the box you get QuickOffice, a superb office program that allows you to create and edit documents in Word format. In fact this review is being typed out on my E7, in a QuickOffice doc, which I will copy and then paste into Amazon's review section on the Web, because the E7 allows all of the versatility of document creation, in a similar way a desktop PC/Mac would.  As for other apps, the Ovi Store offers over 50,000 apps, both paid and free. I'm aware that isn't quite the same as some other app stores, but there really is everything you need in there, from games to useful utilities. And it's growing all the time. Of course, nobody wants to download 4 million apps (or 50,000 for that matter!) - nobody has that much memory in their phones! Pick and chose the ones you are really going to use. Some highlights for me are: Angry Birds Rio, Kayak, fMobi (facebook app) Shazam, Skype, YouTube Downloader, Opera Mobile, Nokia Movie Trailers. Out of those, only Angry Birds wasn't free, but it was only $1.99. Also, by visiting the Nokia Beta Labs, you can -for free- try out beta software such as Nokia Drop, Live View (awesome) and the Sleeping Screen. Google them and have a look, it's good stuff going on in the background for Nokia users.

SYMBIAN^3 OS:  Much has been said about Symbian, usually in direct comparison with Android and iOS. Is it perfect? No. But no phone software is, so therefore it still gets 5 stars from me. The problems with Symbian are ones of personal taste and preference. It does everything I need it to do, it zips through the menu system, it is pleasant on the eye, and it seems (to me) to make sense. The multi-tasking abilities could be snappier, but they work. It does the job it needs to do. Call quality is outstanding, email and messaging are a breeze, the menu system is a bit outdated but still very accessible, the phone allows many customizing options for wallpapers and ringtones - use your own - and any really annoying aspects such as the Calendar not being up-to-date are all being addressed with the upcoming update called Symbian Anna. It will then be updated once more in the near future with Symbian Belle, which seems to offer even more in the way of UI overhaul, much to great benefit of E7 (and N8) owners. So the future looks good, for now.

OVERALL:  I am extremely pleased with this purchase, the Nokia E7 does everything I need a phone to do, and does it all from a design that is elegant and practical. The phone gets 5 stars because, while it has a few shortcomings, these are 1) being addressed in upcoming updates, and 2) ALL mobile phones have their shortcomings.

Nokia is now moving away from Symbian to focus its smartphone efforts with Windows Phone. I don't have a problem with that, because realistically I'll be ready for a new phone in 12 months anyway, and by that time Nokia Windows Phones will be very much part of the mobile landscape. If they bring out an E7 lookalike packed with Windows, I'd think about it. But that's for next year, or later. Right now, I'm extremely happy with my Nokia E7, and I know it'll be fully supported for at least the next year or so.

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't follow the pack. You have a choice! Be a sheep and ""fit in"" with your friends, or get yourself something different, unlocked, reliable, full of capability all wrapped in a pure, perfect design.",Nokia's Symbian Masterpiece,1313020800,7.0,,

The construction is very nice. Appears to be real leather.  The coloring is very nice and the workmanship is very nice too.

These are made in sweden and maybe that's part of the details that are frustrating.  The vendor went and put a big metal Krusell plate in front of the case.  Clearly visible in the pictures but there appears to be a backing to that metal plate in the back that is only covered by the single layer ""sand"" liner.  Why?????  I can see how over the years that's going to be an issue (the inside leather liner will probably tear exposing the metal backing - argh).  Also, if you put your thumb on the metal plate and squeeze you can tell that you're transmitting pressure energy to the screen of your iphone.  very suboptimal and really detracts from the protective features of this case is intended for.  I really wish the vendor had not decided to slap their big metal logo plate right in the middle of the case (which winds up resting on the screen).  It detracts from the protection this case is supposed to offer.  So yes, I've flipped my phone and put it in backside up into the case - so that the hard metal logo plate can't press against my screen. Still...

The second wierd thing is a small metal loop ring in the back.  It comes with a round carabiner style ring.  I have no idea what I'd use that for.  My iphone 4 fits nice and snug but nowhere near snug enough that I'd put this case on some kind of carabiner or keyring - odd.  It would be much cleaner without.

Overall, if you have a bluetooth headset and you don't have to look at your phone all the time, this is a nearly perfect case.

The only slight con is that the two connectors have little slack where they split.  Maybe 3""-4"" for both connectors, so both devices have to be right next to each other.

Consumer Cellular doesn't require a data connection for smart phones, allowing the use of wif-fi instead; however they offer a small 3G data package at a low price...for those times you happen to not be near a free wi-fi.
Because I already had one of their phones, I was able to add a ""New APN"" through the phone's menu (Settings, Wireless & networks, Mobile networks, Access point names, menu) by coping what was in the Bravo phone.  Here is how one needs to fill those fields in:

Name: Consumer Cellular
APN: att.mvno
Proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.com
Port: 80
MMSC:[...]  Amazon doesn't allow a web-link in their reviews, but that is required here.  See below for some hints.
MMS proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.com
MMS port:  80
MCC:  310
MNC:  410
APN type:  default,mms,supl,agps,fota
APN protocol:  IPv4

For the fields not listed above, they are left ""<not set>"".  The MMSC web-link above includes the words ""mmsc.cingular.com"", after the usual ""http..."",
Getting voice connections only required removing the sim card from the Bravo and putting it in the Atrix.

So far, I'm very happy with this phone, with the Atrix being an improvement over the Bravo, having a better camera with a flash, faster processor, more memory, an added rear-facing camera, slightly larger screen, and the Gingerbread 2.3 OS.  After 3 weeks of using the phone, I have never had to reboot it, as I sometimes did with the Bravo's 2.2 OS.

The included bluetooth mouse and keyboard and also work with the lapdock, especially the mouse making a nice accessory for it.  The USB ports on the two docks provide added capability to the Atrix 4G, including the ability to use any USB/wireless mouse. Both the lapdock and multimedia dock allow watching web-based video on a larger screen; however, there is a noticeable, but acceptable (if it is your only option) uneven motion in the video.  However, both video, music and photographs stored in the phone play very well from the phone onto the TV, with the phone making a very nice control device.

Update: A reviewer on another site pointed out that ""older SIM cards (maybe 3-4 years old)"" may also need to be replaced with a newer SIM card for the data connection to work.  After 3 months, my Atrix 4G continues to work great, with the Standard and Laptop Docks being my ""must have"" accessories.

You can read all the reviews for this and the other cutters that are being sold here on Amazon where some people seem to complain about their troubles with cutting their SIM cards into a Micro SIM. However, I think what this all comes down to is whether you are comfortable cutting up your SIM card into a Micro SIM card and whether your SIM card has a gold chip on the card that won't get chopped up by the cutter. From my looking at my old SIM cards for different phones and also looking at pictures of different SIM cards, it looks to me that if the SIM card is an older SIM card, then the chances are the gold chip on the card may be larger in size and therefore the greater the chance that the cutter may chop into it and may possibly render a non-workable SIM for you. If you have a spare SIM card that has the same size chip as on your working SIM card, then try cutting that as practice to see if you can cut the card evenly, and to see if the gold chip is not chopped into, and to also see what the now converted Micro SIM looks like as a result and comparing that result to pictures of actual working Micro SIM cards. Others have complained about how their cutter may not have cut smoothly around the card and had to be trimmed around the edges. I didn't have a problem with that. For me, the cutter cut the SIM nicely and converted it into a Micro SIM that worked fine on my iPhone. If you want to feel more confident about how you are cutting the card, you may want to hold the SIM card in place with your finger at the end on the SIM when the SIM is in the cutter to make sure for yourself that it cuts around the gold chip and that the SIM card doesn't slip out when cutting it. The other complaint that people have are about those sim adapters that came with the cutter. I consider those sim adapters to be ""bonuses"" that are probably never going to get used. If need be, I'm just saving the cut-out frame from the old SIM card for if I want to reinsert and tape the Micro SIM back to its former self as a full-size SIM card for use on my other phone.",Micro SIM Cutter works great,1339200000,63.0,,

As for this bumper, it is quite good. I have owned several different types of iPhone bumpers (for iPhone 2G, 3GS, 4) and I have found these type of edge bumpers to be the best and often the cheapest.

Pros:
1)Smallest form factor.
2)Protects all sides of the iPhone 4, including the front and back glass. You would be amazed how well your iPhone would be protected by this bumper. The only type of drop it doesn't protect are the direct protruding impact on the glass. In other words, if you drop the phone on flat surfaces, your iPhone 4 should do fine with this bumper.
3)Allows most non-Apple cables to plug into the bottom of your iPhone 4.
4)Increases the wireless signal by about a half bar or so.

Cons:
1)The color of this device is not quite as blue as the ones in the picture. I suspect that would be the same for all the colors? (I don't know). Mine came in light sky-blue and wasn't as bluish as the ones in the picture.

The case was genuine Speck in T-Mobile retail packaging. The case is nice but I'm not a huge fan of the fit. There seems to be a lip around the edge of the case. When the lip is locked under the bezel of the phone the buttons don't line up right. The buttons built into the case are raised but the underside of the case isn't hollowed out to accommodate the buttons. If I put the case on the phone but don't push down the lip then it fits better. It feels like a nice case though and for the price it's hard to complain.

Update:  I had to reduce my rating from 3 to 2 stars. I ordered this case and the Speck Candyshell case. The Candyshell case is much better! The PixelSkin HD I received doesn't fit well at all so the buttons don't line up right. Based on other reviews, I will assume the PixelSkin I received may have been defective.... the volume was constantly changing on its own and the camera kept activating, etc. I do not have these issues with the Candyshell and I highly suggest that case!

Not a big deal to me but it would be nice if the seller discloses this on the seller's posting.

Now to the Phone:

The phone is simply very CLASSY. It is originally an AT&T phone but fully unlocked. We have T-mobile service with unlimited data in our family plan.. I did not have to go thru any extra setup or bypass instructions as mentioned by other buyers reviews.  Inserted my SIM card, it made me go thru some setup steps mainly username, password and email addresses and I was up and running in minits. Please be aware that this phone is NOT compatible with T-mobile 3G data service and will work only on the EDGE network (not a big deal for me or my son for what we paid for it). Synced gmail and all contacts came right to the phone. pretty painless. WiFi is a bonus, no problems setting it up. This phone is cute and tiny, just perfect for my 11 year old's tiny fingers (keyboard can be a little tight for someone with thick or fat fingers).. This phone is compatible with touchstone charging capability and I purchased the original touchstone back cover and the charger both less that $ 9.00 combined. Touchscreen is very responsive and smooth. This phone is a great great value for the price and cheaper than most T-mobile's pay-as-you-go phones. I highly recommend this phone as a first phone for your young ones while it is being sold at a throw away price. It is unfortunate that HP decided to the discontinue such a pretty WebOS.

Hope this Info helps future potential buyers.",Simply Classy,1330387200,3.0,,

The circuitry is designed to handle 2.1A, but in USB charging mode, most phones will only draw 500mA, max. If the two center pins of the USB port are soldered together (the data D+ and D- pins, used only for transmitting data), the phone will go into AC charging mode and draw up to 1A.

If you're competent with a soldering iron, this is an easy modification.

1) Unscrew the cap that retains the fuse.
2) Use a thin, small flat screwdriver to pry the silver bezel off the USB port end. Work your way around the edge patiently and it will come off.
3) Now use the screwdriver to pry apart the two halves of the housing, along the seam. The circuit board will come loose when the housing is seperated.

4) Locate the two center pins on the USB port, and heat them both up simultaneously with the soldering iron. If the iron is hot, it should only take a few seconds, and you can apply a small dab of solder to short those two pins together.

Be careful not to touch the soldering iron to anything else on the board and don't apply heat for too long or the USB port can separate from the board.

A couple of things to note
1) the case pushes down on the top power button and starts by wanting to turn the phone off, and then renders the button unusable.  Solution: add a little piece of tape to the top of the iPhone so it keeps the case a hair away from the button and it works fine.
2 ) if you use a screen protector, Gorilamobile will probably fit too tight and will lift it off.  Solution: trim the screen protector first using the Gorilamobile frame as a template.
3) if you use your old iPod cable to sync your iPhone, it will be a hair to big to fit in the slot provided by the Gorilamobile.  Solution: trim the plastic with a knife or dremel.
4) If you use non Apple headphones like Sony studio monitors, the headphone hole is too small.  Solution: get different headphones- I think it might make the case too thin if you shave it.

I approached this purchase with a lot of trepidation due to the schizo nature of the reviews - either loved it, or they hated it.  So far, I love it except for the battery life and sometimes slow GPS acquisition.  I will post an UPDATE after a few weeks or if I encounter problems.

One of the reviewers wrote that a lot of the problems are due to conflicts between apps, so I've only loaded a few apps: Google Gestures (incredible app!!!) and its accompanying Gestures Bar; Google Voice; Yahoo Mail & GPS Test.  So far, no aut-reboots.  I'm keeping track of the apps I install & when in case one of them causes  problems.

BATTERY LIFE - not great.  After 11 hr 39 min of up time the RED LED light came on - battery status showed 8% battery remaining.
8% remaining @ 11 hr 39 min
6% @ 12hr6min
3% after 12hr45.
1% after 13hr30
auto powered off due to drained battery @ 13:32.

I let the battery run out to test the life & to condition it.  I've ordered a 2000 mah battery from eBay which should run a lot longer than the stock 1380 mah battery.  Battery status showed for my usage, the GPS caused the most battery drain:
- Google Maps (i.e. GPS) = 40%
- Cell Standby = 30%
- Cell Idle = 21%  (wonder what's the diff between standby & idle??)
- Display 6% - generally used a medium brightness unless in bright sunlight, then used max brightness.  I do not use the Auto Brightness feature but control the brightness with the Power Widget that allows control of the brightness, & lets you turn on/off the Bluetooth; GPS; Synching; & WiFi from a homescreen toolbar
- WHERE app, which uses GPS = 4%
NOTE about the WHERE APP - I set the phone to NOT use my LOCATION in the apps, but WHERE used it anyway.  I only used the WHERE app to look at the weather, then 10 min later, I noticed that the GPS was STILL RUNNING because of the WHERE app even when I was in a diff app!!!  Google Map stops the GPS signal acquisition when you change to a diff app, but WHERE did NOT.  In that short 10min of ""use"", the WHERE app used up 4% of my battery life! Fortunately the WHERE app has an EXIT app option as the phone does not have a task manager.

GPS - sometimes slow to acquire - a couple of minutes; sometimes less than a minute.  I was usually moving.  I used the GPS TEST app to see the signal strengths and saw that generally, the phone was able to receive strong signals from at least 4 or 5 satellites and often as 8 to 10 satellites. This indicates the Google Map app is the slow factor.  IF I stand still, signals are much faster to acquire & show my location.  NOTE -some wrote that it didn't work at home - GPS signals don't generally go through walls.  Try it by a window with a clear sky view.  This is true for all GPS devices.

PLUSES +++
+ great screen
+ great VM service plan prices
+ light
+ not too much bloatware
+ fast enough for the price
+ good amount of internal memory unlike my Intercept that kept running out of memory
+ Camera seems good as are the videos.
+ nice to have a flash.  Will have to install a flashlight app (Quick Settings has it - see below for more Quick Settings functions).  Of course, that will drain the battery!!!

CONS ---
- Short battery life
- sometimes, though, not always, slow GPS acquisition - one reviewer recommended the GPS STATUS & TOOLBOX app that can reset the GPS.  Will have to try it.
- LACKS a FILE MANAGER app!!!  How can this be?  Transferred files via Bluetooth & couldn't figure out where it was placed.  I don't know if it is in internal memory or on my SD card. I'll have pull the micro SD card out & load it into my PC or connect/mount via USB.
- LACKS the TASK MANAGER which is useful for seeing what apps are running & allows apps to be killed to save battery life.  File Manager & Task Manager were on my Samsung Intercept.
- No attachment point to attach a short leash through which to put a finger or two.  Nice to have a very short leash to avoid dropping the phone. Looks like I might be able to thread my Samsung leash through some chassis holes under the battery cover - we'll see.
- THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE!!! Cannot turn off the VM Power on & Power Off scream!!!  On my Samsung,I had installed the QUICK SETTING free app which has a ""system volume"" setting that when set to ZERO, mutes the Power OFF VM Scream, but not the Power ON Scream.

All in all, I like this phone and have NOT experienced any of the problems some posters have listed : light leakage? auto-rebooting - maybe from installed apps? so I'm going slow with the installs & keeping track of when I install apps; flicker ??? I wouldn't return a phone for a power on flicker, my compact fluorescent lights flicker sometimes when I turn them on - doesn't seem to be a big deal as it does not affect the function of the phone.

Will update in a few weeks.

UDPATE >> 2 weeks later...
Have had 2 auto reboots, but none in the past week.  One day, had a major screen problem whereby the bottom half of the screen was darkened, like when the virtual keyboard is showing, but no KEYS are shown.  This accompanied several problems, such as not being able to shut down phone w/o removing battery.  Then not starting up.  The 1/2 dark screen problem occurred when pressing the search button.  Had to pull out the battery several times to restart phone.  RESOLVED PROBLEM by RESETTING the phone back to original factory condition.  That was a week ago and the problem has NOT reoccurred.  I was ready to send the phone back to AMAZON, but then the GPS started working better.

GPS - was slow to acquire or not acquiring at all.  Called MOTOROLA who was no help. They treated me like an had now idea what I was doing. Then about a 5 days ago,  around 6 UPDATES auto-installed.  These were either bundled apps or OS embedded apps, such as the voice recognition app, the bundled SCVNGR game, etc.  After that, the GPS worked much better.  As far as I could tell none of the auto-updated apps/modules were directly GPS related.  Perhaps one or two of them was interfering with the GPS???
Bottom line, the now GPS works acceptably.  Usually could find my location within 2 minutes, sometimes much more quickly.  There are still some instances when I could not get a location fix, but generally, the GPS performance is acceptable, not stellar, but good enough.
NOTE - I have the GPS TEST app installed which shows the # of satellite signals acquired & their strenght.  Google Maps has a LAG between when GPS TEST shows 4 or more signals.  It almost seems that running the GPS TEST app helps trigger Google Maps to recognize the GPS signals but that's difficult to ascertain.

Battery - bought a 2000 mah battery from eBay for only $5 shipped.  It did not seem to last any longer than the standard 1350mah battery, but a 2nd battery is good to have.  I can generally get 12 - 16 hours on a full charge on either battery.  Obviously your results will vary.  I use the GPS often for transit directions which is a heavy battery drain.

BOTTOM LINE, after 2 weeks, it works much better despite the aforementioned rebooting & screen freezing problem that have not reoccurred.  I will probably keep this phone unless a major problem crops up.","So Far Great, time will tell",1337731200,3.0,,

I'm always so paranoid about my electronics and the idea of an ""ultimate"" case was always appealing to me in theory, but I could never justify the price.  I mention this because let's be honest, almost everyone looking at this Trident case is doing so as a cheaper alternative to the Otterbox.

I haven't seen the Otterbox Commuter case for the iPhone 5 in person but from all the pictures and videos I can already tell that the Trident Aegis case looks better.  The curves, lines and design of the silicone & hard plastic look sleek & modern in comparison to the plain flat back of the Otterbox, which looks bulkier as a result.  The rubber on the Aegis also goes over the area with the home button which not only looks better aesthetically, it helps with protection even more.

According to reviews the new Otterbox case seems to have problems letting you press the power button as well as having issues with the port covers staying closed. So far the ports on the Trident fit snug and stay closed, and the power & home buttons are easily pressed with the case on.  In fact it's kind of fun to press the volume & power buttons, the response from the buttons is quite pleasant. I find myself doing it even when I don't need to. Some people have also reported problems with internet signal strength with the Otterbox on, I have yet to test this with the Trident.

This case does have its problems though.  For one the silicone parts are lint magnets (a problem found in nearly every silicone case including the Otterbox.)  The included screen protector is also completely worthless, not only does it refuse to stay on but it's made out of fairly cheap and stiff material. I've had multiple screen protectors and this is by far the worst, so if you plan on getting this case because it comes with a screen protector be prepared for the cost of buying a separate one.

There's also a slight warp/gap that has appeared on the part of the hard case that goes over the volume buttons, and the silicone area that goes over the home button is pretty loose. Despite this it doesn't seem like the case would easily fall off.  As far as durability goes I haven't had the chance to test some drops but it does feel pretty sturdy and instills me with confidence.  Again I have no way of comparing it to the proven strength of the Otterbox, and there doesn't seem to be anything ""special"" about the hard plastic part when it is separated from the silicone.

The real deciding factors would be with actual drop tests and customer service.  I've heard some people were able to replace their Otterbox cases as much as 5 times over the course of its usage, I'm not sure if Trident has a similar guarantee/customer service (although they did offer to replace my screen protector a week after I contacted them about it. I have yet to receive it.)

Through Amazon the prices were almost identical.  The Otterbox goes for around $27 and I bought my Trident for $24, but it has since gone down to $20 and even $17.50 WITH free shipping.  If you see it at those prices BUY IT - this case is way better than any case in that price range. If you're on the fence about ""hiding"" the sleekness of the iPhone 5 with this case don't be, NO case out there would provide any kind of protection without sacrificing the elegant design of the iPhone.  My friend even has a see-through case that has a rubber ""bumper"" around the edge for her phone and it still looks worse than this case.

Keep in mind that you'll have to calculate the cost of buying a screen protector (although the Gorilla Glass 2 on the iPhone 5 is INSANELY scratch resistant already) but it's hard to resist this case at $17. Time will tell of its durability and their customer service but based on looks and price this beats the Otterbox hands down.  I can see myself changing this to a 4 after a couple of months of usage, the design is really starting to grow on me.  This case would be an easy 5 stars with a worthwhile screen protector & a few videos of someone that has tested its toughness.",Not perfect but a great alternative to the Otterbox,1350000000,5.0,,

I've read some reviews of it not working with some Blackberries.  I've had zero problems.  Here are my list of Pros and Cons.

Pros:
- You don't have to wear it on your ear like a regular headset and take the risk of getting cancer in your ear 20 years from now.j/k
- It is very easy to set up and easy to pair with two different phones if you choose.
- The sleek look of the speakerphone is much improved from last year's model.
- Great battery life! It's been a month using the speakerphone in my car on the first charge and it is still going!
- Good FM transmitter to play your mp3's stored on your BB on your car's FM radio.  I've tried other FM transmitters and they didn't do as well as the Jabra.  The sound quality will be radio quality of course and you will hear some static, but if you find a good frequency it is very usable.
- When talking on your phone through the Jabra speakerphone, it is loud and clear, provided that you have a somewhat quiet interior to your car.  If you have a convertible car then it might not be loud enough for you.
If it is not loud enough then you can just play it through your FM radio!
- One thing I've noticed is that you can leave the power switch on, and it automatically turns off in a couple of minutes if it doesn't detect your phone's Bluetooth signal.  So if you get back into your car and the speakerphone is ""off"", and if your phone gets a call just turn the Jabra off and then on again and the voice will say ""connected"" and it should have answered the call for you and you can start talking. (Some people said in their reviews that you have to turn the speakerphone on and off every time you get in and out of your car, and this is a way around it.)
- It works with your PS3! In my original review I could not get it to work with my PS3 but I finally got it paired correctly(not sure why the PS3 doesn't automatically activate your Bluetooth device after your register and pair it, you have to go to another separate screen and activate it or turn it on). It works fine while playing Modern Warfare 2, and you don't have to wear an annoying headset!

Cons:
- The playback(mp3) buttons could use some improvement. They could have made the buttons raised and perhaps backlit so that you can find them without having to look up at your visor(if that is where you keep it).

Other than the mp3 playback buttons, this is a solid Bluetooth speakerphone. If you can find a good deal on it, it's definitely worth the money.","Great speakerphone, above average FM transmitter, great battery life!",1262908800,3.0,,

The cases are essentially identical in these ways:

  * construction material and basic design:  soft silicone sleeve (or core or skin ) and hard polycarbonate outer shell

  * protection ability and weight (1.24oz for Otterbox and 1.28oz for Incipio)

  * minimal bulk and good fit and alignment of  ports and other openings (camera, mic, speaker)

An overview of user reviews of both products on Amazon turned up these issues and opinions which persuaded me toward the Incipio:

  *The silicone sleeve on both devices was cited as attracting lint and dust, but the complaints against the Otterbox were extensive and serious, but were only rare and minor for the Incipio.  One reviewer said that while all silicone cases tended to catch lint due to the rubbery nature of silicone, the Otterbox was particularly bad (a ""deal breaker""), with even a ""sticky"" quality to it.  I don't know if this is true, but  why risk it?  I keep my phone in my shirt and pants pockets and have not had a lint problem with the Incipio.  Perhaps the Otterbox uses a different kind of silicone, or perhaps there is something to Incipio's claim of an ""anti-static coating"" on the silicon that does not attract lint.

  * The hard shell back on both devices was sometimes cited as too smooth and slick, causing a tendency for the phone to slip away and drop; once again this complaint was much stronger against the Otterbox than the Incipio.  However, I find this claim hard to understand.  Who grips a phone by the back anyway?  I secure the phone on its sides between the crook of my thumb and my fingers, and my palm doesn't even  touch the back.  I assumed this was true for everyone.  The sides on the Incipio are all silicone and provide good grip, even with moist hands.  The Otterbox sides are the smooth hard shell and therefore more inclined to be slippery.

  * By some accounts the silicone covered buttons on the Otterbox are a bit harder to press than those on the Incipio.  I can't attest to this personally, but I find the buttons on the Incipio are very easy to press, even better than without the sleeve.  (They certainly  are easier to press than those of the Otterbox case on my wife's iPhone, but that is possibly due to the iPhone's button and not the case.)

  * The Otterbox has a silicon flap over the ports; this involves a trade-off.  The flaps are promoted as helping to keep out dust and moisture.  Well, dust is unlikely to be a problem.  Moisture, maybe, but  I doubt that the flap will help too much if you drop your phone in the commode.  The tradeoff is inconvenience;  I'm impatient and want to plug in the charger cord and earphones immediately without messing with flaps.

  * Some reviewers felt that it was easier to remove the Incipio case than the Otterbox case in order to change out the battery.  I can only say that judging from the Otterbox case on my wife's iPhone, this is certainly true.  (Of course, one doesn't need to remove the case from the iPhone since it doesn't even have a user replaceable battery.)

  * Price.  The Incipio averages about $5 cheaper than the Otterbox.

  * The real deal breaker for me with the Otterbox was its appearance (color).  The Otterbox only comes in black.  I wanted some color and contrast.  The Incipio offered black but also 2 color combos .  One was  purple (really dark pink) and dark gray.  I chose the other option: dark gray shell  and light gray sleeve.  It is a fine unisex color combo, one which is quite stylish but conservative and which also makes it easy for me to spot my phone on my black desktop or any dark furniture.

My drivers license (DL), credit card (CC) and 2-$20's cash fit in the back. Since I am retired I don't always have my wallet in my pocket and have forgotten it several times. Embarrassing at the check out.

My initial reaction to getting this in my hands was COOL. After looking at it for awhile it looks like the latch system will fail down the road. It really needs to be redesigned. That being said it is working now and only time will tell if it fails. The lifetime warranty is a benefit of course.

With a CC, DL and 2-$20's the case pushes against the back of the phone and tends to push the hard shell towards the back of the phone. Every now and then I just remove the CC, DL and the 2-$20's and push it forward. Problem solved. I have had this for 2 weeks now and only had to do that once.

The door on the back also bulges out even when it is empty. It doesn't get caught on anything and the bulge is small and is pretty minor. At first I thought it was the stuff I had shoved in there but it bulges even when empty. I don't consider that a distraction to an otherwise nice product.

Update: I have had it for 6 months now and have to say that I love it. The latch issue that I was concerned about was a non issue and it keeps latched all the time.

I found that if I push my cards in too far it will cause the case to separate at the front. The solution is to make sure that the cards are not pushed in all the way to the hinge. Since I figured that out the case does not push out on the front.

The one issue is that I have my whole life in my cell phone. Drivers license, gun permit, credit card and a $50 bill. If it gets stolen my life will be turned upside down. That isn't the fault of the case though but it is a concern.",So far so good,1323820800,146.0,,

First, I made sure to research docks before getting one.  Which can be hard since this one didn't have a ton of user reviews right away.  Quickly I did learn that what Verizon was pushing in their stores was not the same as could be ordered from Motorola and elsewhere.  My biggest draw was the integrated audio.  This is a great idea and, in my opinion, worth the premium over the Verizon (which doesn't have the integrated audio cable).  My old Droid dock was just a holder for the phone.  I had to supply the charging cord and the aux cable (which went to the 3.5mm jack in the phone).  It got cluttered, but hey, that's the way is was 2 years ago.

This dock for the MAXX has the connector that slides in to lock the phone in place, charge it, and place audio.  Only one cable that goes into the back of the dock.  Very clean.  2nd USB port is also a plus.  The ""horn"" that comes with this dock has the same size ball as my old Droid dock, as well as my old Garmin, so use which ever you like.  I like my old Garmin because it is more compact and uses a smaller disk.  I haven't had any issue with this dock losing suction, so I'm happy there.  Also, just pressing the phone into the dock without inserting the USB/audio connector is easy and seems to keep the phone in there pretty well.  It isn't to hard to pull it out, just watch for where the volume buttons are so you don't change them accidentally.

I have one gripe.  I use a bluetooth device to [sometimes] talk when I'm driving.  This device is also capable of playing music from my phone.  With my old setup (Droid,dock), I would have BT broadcast enabled on the device, the music to BT option enabled, and a cable in the headphone jack going to my car stereo.  I'm listening to something from my phone and it plays on the car stereo.  When I get a call, it pauses the music on the phone, answers the call via BT device, I talk, hang up, music resumes over car stereo.  Perfect. With the MAXX and its dock, I no longer need to plug anything into the 3.5mm jack while I'm in the car.  The problem is when I have BT function enabled, music to BT option enable, and the integrated USB/audio connect inserted everything is pushed to the BT device.  If I turn off the BT device or disable the BT function on the phone, then music plays through the car stereo.  If I forego the dock and just use an aux cable going to the 3.5mm jack on the phone, then everything works great (as it did w/ the Droid).  This seems like a major oversight and I would think that it is just a software issue (but hey, I didn't design this thing).  Now, this is probably more a flaw of the phone than of the dock, but since Motorola makes both the phone and the dock and both of the items work exclusively with each other, I think people need to know about it. There is no reason the integrated USB/audio connector should affect the transfer of functions to the BT any differently than the 3.5mm jack.

I'll gladly edit if I find out anything new on the BT issue or if an update fixes it.  Overal, great product at an acceptable price, with one oversight.
==================================================================================================================
Edit 6/8/12
I've noticed that over the past month the audio crackles when going over bumps and rough roads.  It is the micro USB connection of the cable to the dock that is failing.  When I hold the connection rigid or switch to using the 3.5mm jack then there are no issues.  After looking at the micro USB side of the cable under magnification I can see that several of the metal prongs are flatter than others.

Now, I first have to admit that I do not drive on the smoothest roads, and even for Wisconsin I think these are some of the worst roads around.  I would still expect better performance than lasting 3 months.  I have taken the review down from 4 stars to 2 because of this.  And to think that I was disappointed with getting only 1 year out of the bad retaining tab on the original Droid....  I expected better from Motorola.  I don't think that expecting this to last more than 3 months was too high.",Great accessory with [several] oversights (downgraded),1332028800,45.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ErDl2j2ZL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mYP9DNssL._SY88.jpg']",

This mobile phone is more than I expected after reading all the reviews found in the web.
Even when there was no ""warranty"" and no stamp in the box about warranty, once you turn it up you will find that this device is amazing.
This one (I bought it from the OEM Shop) is running Andriod 2.3.4 using the UHKG7 kernel, so its not necessary to be updated.
Video calls from Gtalk are not supported in this firmware but the batterylife is quite good. It can last one day (regular use).
Writting with ""SWYPE"" is a very delightfull experience. The swype writting is just one step ahead of the others, is state of the art.
I thought it would be so big to take in my hands, but it isn't, I feel very confortable holding it and also I can take it into my pocket, is very very thin.
The videos and pictures are amazing, very clear. It features 1080p for real, I recorded a video and then I used the Micro USB to HDMI MHL adapter
to plug it to my HDTV and the picture and video quality was perfect!
The screen is perfect, is very clear, it has a very good resolution and everybody around me love the screen of this phone.
I haven't tried the GPS and still other features, but with this ""toy"" there are many things to play with.

While this is the best working and sounding bluetooth I have ever owned, I struggle with the pain left in my ear.  I am unable to wear if for long periods of time, even though it came with 6-different ear pieces, none provide the comfort I find with, say, a Motorolla H710, H715, H721.  While the Motorolla is extremely comfortable, it has a short life span, where it gives up the ghost in less than 8-months of usage.

I am told the Jabra ear gels fit most Jawbone BT headsets & feel much more comfortable, but causes the BT to protrude from the ear too much.  I have not tryed them yet because the reviews are not very convincing or impressive.  I like the Jawbone Prime BT enough to hold out for a confortable ear gel, or till my ear becomes immune to the pain.  The main advantage of the Jawbone, is that it is trully a background noise suppressor, while boasting the best looking BT on the market.

When properly applied, they were awesome: crystal clear, completely stationary (no sliding, no peeling, no emerging bubbles), and shock resistant.

The iPhone 4 era InvisibleSHIELD, however, suffers from a serious manufacturing defect: roller lines. The machine rollers in their manufacturing process are leaving perfectly straight vertical lines on InvisibleSHIELDs coming off the line these days. You won't notice it at first; it will only become apparent once the shield has had 24 hours to dry and the bubbles have all disappeared.

You will then find perfectly straight, well-defined ""rainbow lines"" on the shield that refract light, particularly when your phone is showing a white screen. By holding the phone and shield up to light and turning them back and forth to see the protected screen at different angles, you will notice that there is a line running the length of the shield from rollers during manufacturing.

I have always applied InvisibleSHIELD protectors for family and friends and can do a perfect job each time and every time. This is not installation error; you can hold a ruler against the lines and see that they are perfectly straight and of precise width.

Of the six iPhone 4 protectors I've installed from Zagg, FOUR have had ""rainbow lines"" in them, one of them with TWO perfectly straight parallel ""rainbow lines"" running the length of the screen about a centimeter apart. (Search Google for the term ""rainbow lines""; it's a well-known problem.) Zagg won't honor their lifetime warranty for affected protectors, instead saying it's a normal artifact of their manufacturing process (while some other reps will just tell you you've done a lousy job installing the protector).

So now it's ""normal"" for Zagg InvisibleSHIELD users to have prominent lines that look like screen defects running vertically across the screens of their iPhones. So much for ""invisible.""

In fact, they're extremely distracting and I'm currently looking for a similar wet-applied, soft-protector alternative that has better quality control.

Until Zagg acknowledges and fixes this quality control problem, I can't recommend dropping $20 on a product that will leave you wishing you could still read your pristine iPhone screen. It's a shame, because during the iPhone 3/3GS years this was the ULTIMATE in iPhone screen protection.

I wasn't expecting to get this till monday but it got here 2 days later.
Anyway, it came with a little quick user guide that was in english and i charged it up that night and it was ready to use. So far my call quality is better than my old phone....wierd. i was expecting crappy call quality but what you know! it was easy to program (there are lots of program codes online for this fon including if you want your id blocked and what not). i inserted the sim wrong and it kept saying no sim with the blinking x so i called t-mobile and after the customer service took the mobile id number, She said the phone should be ready to use. Of course i realized the gold plated end of the sim goes in last, the clear part goes in the slot first. Battery life seems good for now. i dropped it in the gym and somewhere else and it still works great. the little user guide was helpful in terms of knowing how to send text messages, know how to find the last numbers dialed and what not.

Once the sim is inserted right and the phone is turned on, you should have a voice telling you to press 3 for english.
From what i know, phone numbers have to be saved to the sim since this phone doesn't have any memory. only one number can be saved per name. it started on vibrate but after toying with it, i managed to change the ringtone.

For the $24.xx i paid total, this beats paying $6 per month for insurance on a phone. i miss the color display but i think i'm getting used to this. it doesn't have a camera but then again i never sent pix mssg, only received. so long as i can make calls and send text messages, i'm fine.
Another thing that might turn ppl off with this phone is the way the letters show up on the screen when you text.
If you ask me, this phone is a good buy. It's thin and it beats paying $80+ for the cheapest t-mobile phone.
For the record, i have t-mobile service and i had no problems getting this phone to work.

Not so much when I was talking, but standby time was absurdly low. It couldn't make it through the night! I assumed it was a bad battery and so I had the seller send me another battery - they did to their credit - right away. I ended up buying a brand new battery but even that didn't help. OK, second, the alarm never worked. Not a big deal. Third, part of the casing for the thing popped off. Not very ""rugged."" Fourth, it stopped being able to take incoming calls about half the time! The phone would ring, but then when I tried to answer - they couldn't hear me. Fifth, the keyboard also wouldnt ""beep"" when I hit keys, no matter what setting I put it on. Sixth and the final straw was when it started calling the last person I called over and over and over. It called my girlfriend 49 times in less than an hour - at midnight when I was sleeping.

I've tested several cellphones (including 2 at a time) as well as a Kindle Fire HD, and it does in fact charge them all. If I could leave it at that then this would be a 5 star item.

But it has a significant flaw. As others have mentioned, if there is any interruption in the solar input - a cloud passing in front of the sun, creeping shadows fron trees or fences later in the day - then the unit stops charging altogether. I found this to be very frustrating, as I have had to keep checking and moving the unit and charging devices far more frequently than I'd like. I don't want a panel that I have to babysit. You often don't know if it's stopped; everything can look perfectly fine, then you go and check it and it's where it was an hour ago because some random cloud cast a shade on the panel and shut the device's charging cycle off...

If you have nice, bright sun all day long and a large open area where shadows will not be a problem, then this charger will work great, because it IS a capable charger in those conditions. If you don't have that then it can be frustrating. Does it still work? Yes, but you have to constantly check on it, resetting your devices (unplugging them and then plugging them back in) very frequently. Without this flaw I'd give it 5 stars, as it is I'd give it maybe 3.5. So it works, just not as great as I'd hoped.

The unit fits well in my ear with the standard ear bud and I like the clip for the ear as well since I wear glasses all the time.  The audio quality seems to be the best I've ever heard and the unit responds to my voice commands all the time, I've never had to repeat or revert to the phone (yet). I used the Bing 411 service once to find a specific restaurant while driving and that went well too.  Very simple and I think that voice control is the technology of the future and it's here now!  My only complaint would be that it seems that the battery doesn't last as long as the documentation says it does.  While I was on it the first day after a full charge for about 2 hours and about 10 hours of standby time, it told me the battery was very low.  That's nothing compared to the 5 hours of talk and 100 hrs of standby they claim.  It seems to be lasting longer today though, but I will keep the 4 star review because of it.

The VLINGO app that comes with it (downloaded to my BlackBerry) is very useful, but it has some quirks.  When initially setup, it will read your incoming email, SMS and MMS messages. Yes, MMS messages too. This means that picture messages are read such as ""message from 888111003243897848703980012487038038403"", subject ""47907847743029380483084208324234"", well you get the idea.  Once I shut off the email reading feature and just have it read the text messages, it's much more useful.  However, if the headset is not connected, it will read your texts out load (as in speakerphone).

While there are dozens of phone repair tutorials out on the web that tell you what tools you need (pry tool, torx screwdrivers, philips screwdrivers), most of them don't tell you that you need some kind of adhesive. Well I'm confirming that if you have a smartphone and you don't want the LCD screen and digitizer to slip/fall out, you need adhesive. With that said, I bought this one.

My complaints of other reviews are that the ratings for this product is all over the place. People complain about the location, ship speed, quality but they never mention who they bought it from. If you're reading my review, take notice that MULTIPLE 3rd parties sell this exact same item. So who you pick as your seller determines all that.

With that said, the vendor I chose was ""BESTLED"", also listed as ""Besthongkong Technology Company Limited"". The reason I chose them is that despite their location is Hong Kong, *SOME ITEMS* they sell are via Amazon fulfillment, which makes them:
1) Eligible for Amazon Prime (I got mine in 2 days)
2) Shipments are based out of the United States
The price I got it for was $4.29 when I ordered it.
NOTE: At the time, they had it as Amazon Fulfilment - Amazon Prime. As of 9/21/2012, this item from ""BESTLED"" is not valid for Amazon Prime anymore. So be aware that this might come from overseas.

Obviously this is cut from a main roll of the same stuff. For those of you that didn't realize, this is how they cut tape down to a specific size. Whether it's Scotch tape, duct tape, electrical tape, sticker tape; it all comes from a bigger roll. My item was *expertly cut*. There were no jaggy edges or accidents. The entire roll was uniform in size.

As for quality, this is a legit 3M product. The adhesive is very sticky and decently strong. It's not strong like super glue but it is strong enough to keep your screen/digitizer from slipping and is strong enough to adhere it to the assembly.

As for the quantity, I'm not sure how one would ever use this much unless they were in the profession of phone repairs. I got it simply because this is one item required for phone repair and I only used about a 8 inches of it (I had to repair two phones). Estimating the remaining amount, I still have plenty to for at least 30 phones or more.

Full review: I don't expect much from a dashboard mount for my phone. All I expect it to do is keep my phone on the dash. When I tested this mount, it literally slid off the dashboard as I was backing out of my driveway! The base is flat and rigid and does not conform to a curved dash. The bottom is not the sticky/tacky rubber found on Garmin friction mounts, its a type of foam rubber that slides far too easily. Since my Cobalt's dash curves and slopes gently, this mount kept sliding off (yes I cleaned the dashboard before testing). So, like I said, if you have a flat dash, great, this will work for you, if you have a curved or sloping dash, don't buy it!

That said, the other portion of this mount, the suction cup, arm, etc. works great. I like the spring-loaded arms, it worked great on my iPhone 4.

The best solution I've found for a phone mount is Exogear's suction mount.

The case is a hard case doubled with a rubber sleeve.  The rubber sleeve goes on first and then that goes in the hard case.  The rubber sleeve covers the buttons and protects them from dirt and grime.  I really like this design because it prevents dirt and grime from getting between the case and the phone.  I have had some soft cases and hard cases that did protect the phone somewhat, but after months of use dirt did get in between the case and the phone.

The hard case is textured and definitely improves the grip of the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket; which is very slick and slippery otherwise.  The case also makes the phone feel a lot more sturdy.  The case does not attract lint in your pocket like so many cases/sleeves do.

However, this screen saver is applied with a solution similar to a few others out there.  Yes, the install process seems a little more involved but it really isn't.  Just wet your fingers, wet both sides of the protector, slap in on and work out the bubbles.  The best thing is that you can slide it around to get that perfect fit unlike the dry apply protectors which once they stick to the surface good luck adjusting it.

Believe me, I have tried a bunch of protectors and this one is great especially if you are a novice at installing.  Once installed the micro bubble disappear over the next few days and it is perfect.  Can't tell it is there and doesn't affect resolution or usability.

Simple put:

It works perfectly with Note 2 and the S-Pen. Sensors all work fine. I used to have ultra crystal on Note, and Oleophobic do reduce finger prints and other oily elements better. Still need to wipe it from time to time, but it surely relived the issue to an extent.

However:

Can't stand the smaller size of film than the screen itself. Sure, there might be technical difficulties, but from the perspective of users, I can't recommend for the film's smaller size than the phone's screen.. This does two things very well: 1)Making film very easy to see and reduce the cosmetic of the phone; 2)The edge of the screen doesn't get protection. People say it's not a big deal because it's just small portion of the screen, but I'm sure we won't be happy to have the ""small"" portion of the screen scratched by dirt/sand or some other elements. A bonus *goodness* this smaller size does to the phone is that it block half of the notification light :( What's about this? It looks like I'm using a film that is designed for an S3, not even compatible with my Note 2 because that ""blocking half of the notification light"" says it all.

Conclusion:

To be fair, I can only give it a neutral rating. It has good quality and looks nice on where it covers. It is not a precise fit and makes me feel that it is not well-designed.

Other thoughts:

These films do have much less hardness than glass (duh), so they get some fine scratches easily, which means that you still need to be careful about the screen if you don't want to scratch it all up and look ugly in less than 2 months. I had this experience with ultra crystal. Seeing that Oleophobic has lower hardness rating from Spigen, it probably won't last longer than my previous ultra crystal. This is why I would love to pay a premium for glas.t. Spigen just don't have it yet. Hopefully some time soon we'll all enjoy the awesomeness of a protection *film* that is as hard as a gorilla glass, i.e. the glas.t  :)

P.S., if you don't mind the un-precise fit, get it w/o hesitation, the quality of the film is still top-notch.

P.P.S., OH BTW, use the method in this video from youtube!

Regarding the USB port on your computer, it needs to provide at least 500mA of current (2000mA is better), some older machines have USB ports that don't provide that much.  You can try to adjust the hardware settings in Windows or Linux, but some older machines simply won't do it.

I understand that it needs to be modified for the Tab 7 ""2"", but one of the other reviewers explained in detail how to do that, it looks simple.  I also understand that it will not work at all with the original Tab 7 ... it has to be a ""Plus"" or a ""2"".

Works great with my ""Plus"", and I'm quite happy with it.

By the way, it's designed to hold the tablet in portrait mode, but you can also tip the whole affair over on it's side, and while the tablet is still plugged in to the normal location, it will hold it up on it's side, for landscape viewing ... not perfect, but it works.

Jain,"A few weeks ago I was looking for a mounting solution for my iPhone in my Dodge truck, and was intrigued by the description and reviews I saw of this one.  A few days later, it arrived & I began experimenting with different ways to mount it.  The more ways I tried, the more I realized how versatile of a mount this is.  My mounting location of choice was the overhanging lip of the dashboard, above and to the right of the steering wheel.  However, the dash is composed of sort of rippled, patterned plastic, and I seriously doubted that I could get any kind of suction cup mount to work.

Amazingly, the ""Smart Pad"" that comes with this mount solves this problem perfectly, although it is not very well described in the enclosed instructions.  The Smart Pad is simply a tacky, very soft rubber-like disc, which is placed between a non-uniform mounting surface, and the suction cup mount.  Somehow, by applying suction against it from the suction cup mount side, the soft surface against the non-uniform mounting surface conforms to that surface and maintains suction against it.  Once I figured this out, I successfully managed to mount my iPhone just above and to the right of steering wheel.  I set it up so that it was easily visible while driving, got good GPS reception through the windshield, and was easily touched from my right hand, even while holding on to the steering wheel.

But, how well would it hang on to the overhanging lip, and how long would it stay?  The true test came right away: a drive from from Arizona to Alaska via the Alaska Highway - four days of normal road vibration, followed by about two days of rough roads with potholes, and frostheaves.  The result: it didn't come off even once.  I had to worry about mosquitoes, shifting trailer loads, and high gas prices.  But never about my iPhone coming loose.

A couple of weeks later, it continues to hang on tightly.  No longer do I have to fumble around with my iPhone to change songs, or try to wrestle it out from in between the seats, where it's slid into on a corner.

Hurricane Sandy rolled through this week, and we had our first real test of the lanterns when the power went out (and stayed out).  The Eddie Bauer lantern was not as bright and lasted only about an hour before going dim.  The no-brand lantern lasted a bit longer but was very difficult to use -- it wasn't configured to put the light where needed.  Our d.lights, on the other hand, performed flawlessly.  We used both the area lantern (the d.light S10) and also this task light (d.light S1).  The area lantern (the S10) kept large (15x30 foot) living spaces lit well enough to work (preparing dinner, etc.).  And the task light (S1) was fantastic for reading, doing paperwork, etc.  All of the d.light lanterns lasted from sundown to bed time at full brightness -- the S10 lanterns were on the whole time (about 6 hours), while the S1 task lights were used intermittently (probably 3-4 hours).  Both the S10 and the S1 are designed for functionality -- the area lantern is very easy to hang, and the S1 task light puts light right where you need it.  Last but not least, they recharged the next day with only partial sunlight and were ready to go for a second night.

Long and the short of it:  D.light lanterns are awesome!  Hands down, these are the best power outage lanterns available, and at a great price.  I just placed an order for a few more.  These are far more valuable than battery-eating flashlights when facing a sustained power outage.

Y. &#039;Photographer | Outdoor Enthusiast | Tech Pro&#039;,"I go on a lot of camping, hiking, and backpacking/trekking trips where no electricity is available. For months, my friend brought his Energizer external battery pack to charge his iPhone, and friends' phones on our return home. The gadget person I am, I set out to purchase my own. However, reviews of the Energizer pack and other brands were not favorable, until I came across New Trent's products.

I decided to buy the IMP500 for its great look (love the blue accents and rounded/bezeled edges/corners) and excellent reviews. It claims to charge a smartphone several times before running out of juice, and it was the right size for me to take on a backpacking trip.

I took it on my 2-week trip to Peru: a 4-day Inca Trail trek to Machu Picchu, and a 1-week stay at the Peruvian Amazon Forest lodge, Inca Terra, and was never once disappointed. It charged my Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone, and 2 iPod Touch devices.

Comes with a cloth pouch to store the battery pack, but there was no way to include the charging cable without scratching the battery pack's glossy interior. Which now brings me to the biggest issue with the product:

The charging cable is proprietary. One end is USB, and the other is proprietary. I wish it was micro-USB based on the proprietary end so that in the event I lose the charging cable, I could use my smartphone's cable.

Another improvement suggestion would be to allow you to manually turn off the battery pack -- currently, you have to leave it on and let a timeout shut it off. Perhaps New Trent could allow the user to long-hold the power button to manually force shut off?

With that said, a 2-device charging version came out weeks after I purchased the product, and seeing how well the IMP500 works, I wish that I would have bought the 2-device version instead. Either way, I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone. I may purchase the more powerful 11,000mAH sibling in the future (which also allows charging of tablets like the iPad), but have no need for it right now.

So I ordered the elago S5 Slim Fit 2 Case just hoping for a good fit and enough protection to tide me over until I found the ""right"" case.

To my surprise, this case is a great deal more than what I expected.  It is slick and minimal with a barely there imprint of a logo on the lower back corner.  The look is matte and the color (I ordered orange) is bold without being too safety orange bright.  The fit is close to if not perfect without any gap or slide with the iPhone 5 inserted.  What is really unexpected is the leather feel of the ""Soft Feeling Orange"" that is grippy but still smooth enough to go in and out of my front pants pocket that also holds my wallet with ease.  Also, the orange looks especially cool with my white iPhone 5. Access to all buttons and plugs are on target.  This is not a tank for throwing around.  I feel confident that it can withstand the occasional bumps and slip out of the hand, but I won't be throwing it around since it is so light and thin.  The case went on fine and with no issue together with my i-Blason HD Clear 100% Bubble Free Screen Protector for New Apple iPhone 5 (also in white).

This case is erfect for a great look and instant protection, that is light and definitely shows off the excellent industrial design of the iPhone 5.

It's color is more green than blue, it's like a faded retro green paint you'd find on a well-kept Vespa :)

Both pros and cons revolve around the logo round hole that was found in the Elago S4 slimfit 1:
Pro: It was my pet peeve that I used to be annoyed by the misaligned Apple logo vs the hole which I am glad is now gone!
Con: it was easier to push the phone out of the very-snug case with that logo hole. Some may find it difficult to remove but It's not a big problem for me after going through about 4 different Elago S4 slimfit 1 before this. (note from Editor: all 4 are still functional and not broken but now that I have these 3 new loves, I wouldnt be taking them out for a while lol)

Between the different textures, I found the matt soft-feel Silver least slippery, followed by this glossy Coral and the most slippery would be the semi-gloss metalic Grey. But I worship the grounds my iphone walks on so regardless of its slippery-scale, I try to be careful.

The fit is fantastic. Enough said. You wouldnt find a slimmer case out there that feels as light-yet-solid unlike those cheap thin ones that doesnt add bulk nor confidence O_o

The sound quality is excellent. I dont' miss the behind-the-ear straps at all, they got irritating after a while. Paired with my iphone very quickly. I like the one button control scheme, you use the same button to power on, pair, power off, receive calls, and play/pause. Seems to work well so far.

- Otterbox will totally cover the camera lens and also the screen.  This from Seidio separately covers the screen with a static cling film (which is good in covering the screen- but not so great it keeping out all dust probably).
- The outer case can be removed to reveal the smaller more slender ""innocase"" inside; which is kind of cool if you want to maybe go ""not so rugged"" some days and stick the phone in your pocket
- The holster I thought would be cheap... and while it's no otterbox- it's not cheap.  I think that it is actually easier to put my phone in my holster without looking now.  The felt that is inside of the holster feels like it will almost surely come off over time.
-Kickstand doesn't work with the rugged case on; it does with the competitor's case.
- The Camera cover is just not a good design in my opinion.  I take pictures for work and play throughout the day.  You either have to hold back the rubber piece to get it away from the lens (difficult); or work on getting that rubber piece to stay put by shoving the knob into that small hole (extremely difficult).  I'm beginning to wonder if it will actually scratch the lens rather than protect it! It's crossed my mind to make a strategic cut and remove the camera cover- but I think what would remain on the case would make it look like it were missing something.  IF Seidio were to redesign this- I would have put just a clear plastic piece (similar to Otterbox) on the hard shell cover.
- It should be noted that this case was AVAILABLE and CHEAPER than the otterbox through Amazon.  If I were standing in the store and they both were the same price- no question- CHOOSE OTTERBOX.

Overall- worth what I paid; but hands down would have chose Otterbox if it was availalble.  If you are asking yourself do I pay $35 for this or $50 for the Otterbox that is not available- choose the later.

She was extremely disappointed that she had to get a phone that was so much larger than her previous phone.  One thing she loved on her Aria was the orange argyle case we bought for it from Amazon.  Naturally, when you see 5 cases for such a low price, you have to have second thoughts on quality; but we decided to give these a try.

As these were designed for the International version of the Galaxy S II, I wanted to point out the few areas where the case doesn't quite line up with the AT&T version;
- The charger plug opening is just a fraction too small for the factory supplied cord.  I used an Exacto-style knife to cut the opening a little wider.  Otherwise it was pushing the charger plug out and the phone would stop charging.
- There is an opening for a lanyard on the top-left side of the case, the AT&T phone does not have a lanyard connection point; so this hole is just open to nothing.  It is a small hole, so no big deal.
- The noise cancellation microphone hole on the top of the case is just a fraction of an inch away from the microphone hole on the phone.  This does not seem to reduce call quality in any way.  My Otterbox Commuter case has the same issue and we've never had an issue on my phone with call quality either.

The cases themselves;
- Are pretty well fit, I don't notice any gaps or issues around the edges.  They do not seem to want to pop off too easily.
- Have a nice grip to them.  My wife was always afraid she was going to drop the phone itself, as it is a little slippery.  Now she is comfortable handling the phone as the case is much easier for her to hold.
- Are very bright when off of the phone, but the combination of the phone's coloration with the cases makes them a little more muted.  This suits my wife just fine as she prefers darker reds, greens and blues.

The only downsides I see with these cases are;
- We have to find somewhere to store the not-in-use cases.
- My wife changes the cases all the time, I keep looking for the wrong color when I go get her phone!

We have not dropped the phone yet (hopefully we won't have to test that part of these cases).

4.0,True,2012-05-17,AWKVHN3833KVW,B0013G8PTS,,Laurence Holbrook,"This device seems to be working fairly well - at first it was confusing and the manual provided minimal information -

I wasn't expecting it and I'm not sure why, but the IMP52D has a laser pointer - a quick click of the single button turns it on and off -

A 2 Second Hold Click of the single button turns the charging battery pack on and off - blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicate the current level of charge - when I first received the IMP52D, only blue light 2 would illuminate - after a few hours of charging all 3 (blue lights 2, 3 & 4) illuminate when I turn the battery pack on

If the IMP52D is being charged, blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicate 'charging status' - at first, blue light 2 would come on, blue light 3 would come on and blue light 4 would come on, the all 3 went out and the cycle was repeated - after a while blue light 2 remained illuminated while blue lights 3 and 4 would come on sequentially and then simultaneously go out - eventually blue lights 2 & 3 are staying illuminated and light 4 is blinking on and off - after a while (about 8 hours) all 3 lights remain illuminated presumably indicating the the IMP52D is fully charged -

Apparently blue light 1 only illuminates when a device is connected AND the battery pack is on -

Lastly, another I wasn't expecting it and I don't know why, but the IMP52D has an LED light - a 3 Second Hold Click will turn the LED light on or off - if the battery pack was not on, the 3 Second Hold Click will also turn the battery pack on when it turns on the LED light - Turning the LED light off also turns off the battery pack -

Be aware, the IMP52D does NOT include a 110V USB charger - and it does NOT include an iPhone USB cord - it does include a USB cable with a USB 5-Pin Mini B connector and a USB 5-Pin Micro connector - the USB Micro 5-Pin connector will connect the IMP52D to a 110V USB Charger - it will also connect the IMP52D to my Kindle Reader - A cloth carrying case is also included -

I have chargers for my iPhone when I'm at home and in my vehicle - I'm hoping that I can put this in my purse and for those times when my iPhone is dead or almost dead, I can plug the IMP52D in and use my iPhone until I get a chance to charge it -
---------------------------------
Details -

At first I was quite confused on how to use the device and whether it was even working or not, so I kept notes as I 'played' with it - The IMP52D has 4 blue indicating lights, left to right - I'll identify them as 1, 2, 3 & 4 - and one button that can be 'Quick Clicked', 'Click and 2 Second Hold' or 'Click and 3 Second Hold' -

Plugged into USB charger with a cable to charge the IMP52D:
 * First received it, lights 2, 3, & 4 come on, one at a time, left to right and stay lit until all 3 are on - then they shut off and the cycle repeats -
 * After about 1/2 hour, blue light 2 is continuously lit - light 3 & 4 come on, one at a time, left to right, and stay lit until all 3 are on - then lights 3 & 4 shut off and the cycle repeats -
 * After about 6 hours, blue lights 2 & 3 are continuously lit - light 4 is blinking on & off -
 * After about 8 hours, blue lights 2, 3 & 4 are continuously lit, presumably indicating the IMP52D is fully charged

The IMP52D charged from both my 110V Apple USB charger and my Amazon Kindle USB charger - the IMP52D also charged using either the included cable or my Amazon Kindle Reader cable -
------------------------------------------
The manual identifies 3 button clicks

Quick click - this one is easy - it always turns the laser light on or off - although at first, I was mystified at why this red light kept coming on & off -

2 Second Hold Click - also pretty easy, it turns the IMP52D battery pack on & off -

I believe blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicate the charge available - when I first received the IMP52D, turning the battery pack on displayed blue light 2 - after about 3 hours of charging, turning on the battery pack displayed blue lights 2 & 3 - after about 5 hours of charging, blue lights 2, 3 & 4 illuminate when I turn the battery pack on -

I believe blue light 1 indicates IMP52D is charging a device, that is the battery pack is on AND a device is connected - both must be true for blue light 1 to illuminate -

IF my iPhone is connected to the IMP52D and the battery pack is on
 * blue light 1 lights and stays on -
 * the battery appears on the iPhone lock screen indicating the IMP52D is charging the iPhone battery -
 * additional blue lights (2, 2+3 or 2+3+4) may be iilluminated indicating the charge level -

A 3 Second Hold Click turns on the battery pack (if it's not already on) and also turns on the LED light - again at first, I was confused by the white light going on & off -

A 2 Second Hold Click shuts both the LED light and the battery pack off - I don't think it's possible to turn the LED light off and not turn off the battery pack at the same time -

If the battery pack were on and you perform a 3 Second Hold Click, the battery pack will stay on and the LED light will come on - if you attempt to do a 3 Second Hold Click, the battery pack and the LED light will both shut off after 2 seconds -

The above Clicks all work
 * if nothing is connected to the IMP52D or
 * if the IMP52D is being charged or
 * if the IMP52D is charging a device or
 * if the IMP52D is both being charged and charging a device -

If the IMP52D itself is being charged, blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicating the charging status, whether or not a device is connected, that is they will continue the blink pattern -

If a device is connected to the IMP52D to be charged AND the battery pack is turned on, blue light 1 will illuminate, whether or not the IMP52D is itself being charged - if the IMP52D is not itself being charged, the blue lights 2, 3 & 4 may illuminate depending on the battery pack charge level -

Update: the IMP52D will fully recharge a depleted battery (1420 mAh) on my iPhone 4 twice before needing a recharge itself - when I attempted to recharge my iPhone a third time, the IMP52D was able to raise the charge from 15% to 25% before it quit - also, it takes the IMP52D about an hour to recharge my iPhone -","Confusing, but it works well",1337212800,7.0,,

Pairing was no effort at all. it paired with my evo just by turning it on. It is made pretty well also, its not some fragile piece of plastic. Using the FM feature was easy. The quality of that is just ok. I was initially dissapointed in the sound quality totally at first.

Lots of hiss going on behind the music from my phone. It was closer to AM radio sounding, thin and noisy. I had to plug the roadster back in to charge and there was all of a sudden a notable increase in sound.  It easily could mean that the unit wasn't charged enough to begin with, but i personally will keep it connected to the lighter outlet for good. The music sounded far better, and after setting some eq on the player  it sounded even that much better.

If i took the charger off, the volume dropped as did the quality. I don't know if its the player im using or the motorola but there is also TONS of compression on the music coming from the phone. Again, it was far better when on the charger.

Phone calls seem to be just fine.  That is the primary reason for this unit, hand free calls, and it performs this task nicely. I haven't used the speech to text feature for texting, but my phone has that built in already anyway and is not a concern to me.  I wanted it for the hands free of course, but equally to play mp3's through.  And i should also point out, that with the 4.3 inch screen of my phone, i have converted movies for the phone also.  An added benefit, is that on a long drive, if my son is up for watching a bit of a movie or play a video game, the unit plays all of the audio through the car speakers just as the mp3 player does, so it does also make it easier for him to hear the audio of a movie or show or youtube vid etc over highway noise.

And i can also hear what he's downloading from youtube! :) A feature that i personally appreciate.

i paid $62 total including free shipping from Amazon, so it didn't break the bank by any means. local stores (sprint, BestBuy) were asking $100, so i'm perfectly happy with the price.

Pro:
* Good wind noise reduction when outside
* Pairs very easily with the devices I've tried.
* Reasonable battery life - I can talk for 4 or 5 hours in a day with no problems.

Cons:
* Bad sound quality: I get reports from listeners of echos, clipped speech and low sound volume regularly. I know it's not the cell service b/c when I switch to the device directly listeners say ""Ah, that's much better now.""
* Bulky: it's fairly big as a device around the ear, so wearing sunglasses and this device isn't great.
* Annoying: After fully charging overnight, the device will report ""battery medium"" after about an hour of use. To make it worse, it actually says ""Battery medium"" in a British female voice during a call, causing me to miss words of the other party. *This cannot be disabled.*

The power switch is on the side -- you simply slide the switch to turn the power off and on, and a recorded voice informs you how much ""talk time"" is left on the battery, which is a nice feature, as well as whether or not your phone is connected. The switch also has red and green coloring, so it's easy to tell at a glance whether the headset is on or off.

Having setup with a new phone just the other day, I can also note how delighted I am with the voice-guided pairing instructions -- I'm confident that even non-techies could set this headset up without any problems.

I've never bothered to use the voice-answer option, but I do like the single button that can be pressed to answer. I'e used several headsets in the past, and these Plantronics M155/M165 are the most crisp and clear that I've used; my mother (who has hearing problems) almost never has trouble hearing me on this, outside of the usual limitations like outdoor wind or a bad connection. Mostly I use these headsets to listen to audiobooks, though, and I love the extended battery life on these -- the M155 has 4 hours of non-stop listening time (and idles well), and the M165 has 7 hours. If the big talk button would also work as a Pause/Play button with my Audible app (it doesn't), then I'd be in heaven but I suppose we can't have everything.

The only downside to these headsets is perhaps that the range is not so hot. The product description seems to be claiming 33 feet (!); I'd peg it as closer to 8-12 feet. I have noticed that when I'm walking into work, I have to hold the phone in my hand or purse if I don't want my audiobook to cut out -- if I place it in my pants pocket, the connection seems to skip a little, but if my phone is in my relatively steadier hand or purse then the connection is rock solid.

I've loaded up a picture of the M155 and the M165 on the product images: the M155 is very slightly thinner and lighter than the M165, but my ear can't tell the difference. I'm thrilled with both models and highly recommend them.

This gives the phone an anti-skid quality, which is nice when laying it on the dashboard of your car while driving. However, it makes it that much more ""sticky"" when sliding it in and out of a pocket. Not that you'll do a whole lot of that (especially females with smaller pockets) - the phone's pretty huge already. This case adds some bulk. I won't be reviewing the holster as we don't use it.

My daughter has noted a couple of issues. First, the included screen guard is built in. It's part of the hard plastic inner layer and the phone slides into it like a hot pocket into a microwavable sleeve (maybe I'm hungry while I write this review). The touch sensitivity is fine. However, since the screen guard isn't the semi-adhesive style, dust tends to get behind it. Taking the case apart to clean it requires some labor as the rubber part of the case must be ""peeled off"" the plastic part, then stretched over the edges of the plastic layer when it's put back together so it's ""locked"" in place.

Another issue is that the headphone hole doesn't accommodate most plugs due to its small size. I'll be taking a drill to hers soon.

I've long been a fan of Otterbox cases. I own one for my Moto Atrix 2 and love it. Of course, it's everything this case is not. The only thing they have in common is they are both tough.

I have had this 3 days, have NOT read the manual, but browsed it to find missing features
This beautiful phone needs 3-4 hours with the manual - then  I will rewrite this review.

I OFFER this to you and TO NOKIA as an ""OUT OF BOX USER EXPERIENCE"".
When Nokia decided to save 1 day of developer/QA time they multiplied their CUSTOMER SUPPORT costs 1000 fold, and risk WAVES of customers migrating to iPhone, HTC, Android and even Motorola...

I chose this unit because it was rated 4 1/2 stars and had a 2 year model run ... certainly ALL THE BUGS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WORKED OUT??

PLUS:
  Read all the other reviews, the ""plusses"" are undeniable
  *AND* it's INACCURATE to call it ""GRAY"" ...it is silver/steel/iridescent ... solid, BEAUTIFUL !

MINUS - right out of the BOX deal breakers!
 A. VOICE DIAL - FAILS AND RESETS / CRASHES PHONE ... I never read this in any review.
  SOLUTION: Many have reported this in Nokia's forum.
  The fix?  NOT a software update!
  But Nokia's analyst Huddle offers this MOST EMBARRASSING fix.
 1. ""Change language to Philipino (only Auto, English, Spanish and French on my phone, I chose Spanish)
 2. Phone announces will restart and does
 3. ""Change back to your language"" (I chose English not Automatic)... restart again
 4. IT NO LONGER CRASHES, .... it has 30-40% accuracy and does NOT confirm which number of contact it will call.  My much maligned Motorola models from E815 to Z9 had absolutely natural and accurate voice dial. The Nokia E71 has a robotic voice that starts dialing before you can find the STOP button in a panic.

B. GPS - menu navigation is cumbersome, it bumps you from level 3 back up to level 1, and says SEVEN DAY TRIAL ... although this was NOT what I read here in Amazon before I bought it.

C. Text Message In box not found ... I'll spend a day with the Manual and update this review

3.9 STARS *if and only if* you commute by train and DO NOT DRIVE NOR NEED VOICE DIAL.
  The handy keyboard SACRIFICES dialing safety for EASE OF MESSAGING ... very critical for SAFETY

1 1/2 stars or less if Nokia thinks SO POORLY of their customers to offer a CRASHING PHONE for the MOST BASIC function  ... offer such an embarrassing fix ... What good is GPS, Barcode Reader (yes! 2D not the 1D simple stuff you see on retail labels), Wireless Keyboard interface, if it will not make a handsfree phone call in traffic when the technology has had 5+ years to be refined?  Motorola and Nokia ought to swap engineers and MAKE THEM USE THEIR OWN PHONES before selling it.

After that it was tolerable and now it's not noticeable.  The glue holding the rubber to the base has melted a bit, though, so some of the rubber strips have shifted out of place and cat hair and dust have clung to the exposed glue.  That's not really a deal-breaker for me because I only see that when I take the laptop off the cooling pad, but it is a bit gross.

I like to carry my phone in my front pocket so I don't want a case that adds too much thickness to the phone. I don't like gel cases because they don't fit snugly around the phone and the phone tends to slide around in them, also they don't slide in and out of a pocket well. I don't like hard cases either because they don't provide the shock protection like the gel cases do and they break easy if you drop them.

My phone was saved but I had to buy a new case. So then I purchased the Otterbox Commuter for the my EVO.

The Amzer ""Silicone Skin Case"" is completely unacceptable in terms of fit, feel and function.  The Vibrant is a top of the line, expensive and amazing device deserving of quality accessories.  This case is basically junk and not commensurate with the quality of the Vibrant.

  First the fit: It slides onto the Vibrant easily enough (too easily in fact - it feels like it might fall off) and ALMOST all of the cutouts are all lined up with the camera, USB, etc.  Unfortunately, the mic button is covered by the case so the speakerphone or speech to text will not work correctly.  Furthermore, the case barely reaches around the bezel and it fits the face of the phone unevenly so you can see the bezel on one side but not the other side. The last point about the fit is that the phone feels like it could pop out of the case if you squeezed the sides; this is a very unsettling feeling.  A case should make you feel more secure not less, it should have cutouts, especially for something as important as the microphone and it lastly, the case shouldn't detract from the quality appearance of this device. The Amzer case just looks shoddy.

  Second, the feel: The case is very, very thin along the sides, the corners feel nice and thick as they should be to protect the phone.  The sides however are too thin and offer little in the way of protection.  It just feels cheap and not nearly thick enough to offer much protection.

  Third, the function: I am buying a case to protect the phone from damage in the event it is dropped.  I want a little protection around the bezel and the sides and back of the phone.  This case only seems to protect the Vibrant on the corners which are thicker. I feel like if I dropped the phone and it landed on the side there would be little to prevent the phone from being damaged.  If the phone were to fall on its face I'm afraid the bezel or screen could easily be damaged because the Amzer doesn't reach around the bezel fully.

  Needless to say I was disappointed when I tried the Amzer on my Vibrant this afternoon. So much so that I immediately called Amazon to arrange for its return.  I have the Gel Case from Tmobile which by comparison is vastly superior although 55% more in price.  You get what you pay for.  And I do not want to skimp on protection a device as valuable as the Vibrant.  Let's see, save $6 on a case for a $500 phone?  No way, not when it's ugly when installed, feels cheap and insecure in the hand, and offers less protection.  The Tmobile case fits snugly, wraps evenly around the bezel, is thick enough to protect the phone in the event of an impact.

  If I could go .5 stars I would but since I cannot, I will have to go with one star and this review - avoid this product.

Edit: I have posted full frontal photos of both the Tmobile and the Amzer cases installed.  They are clearly labeled but I'm not sure if Amazon will allow them to go up.

Edit #2: It turns out that reviewer ""M"" really thinks that he/she owns an Amzer case...  If you read the comments under M's review you will see that M says ""I bought it at the Tmobile store"" That would be impossible because they don't sell the Amzer at their stores, they sell their own case. And the images M posted were definitely of the Tmobile gel case.

Other than none of the earpieces really fitting great, the sound quality was very good, but volume was too low if in a noisy environment due to the fit.  I would have preferred if the earpiece went deeper in the ear like an in-ear headset, but to have the different wearing options it can't be that pointy.  Probably a good compromise and I ended up using the earpiece with the extra rubber loop that sits in the outer part of the ear.  Very comfortable although I'm not the type to walk around with a headset, so did not keep it in for extended periods.

No one I talked with complained about voice quality and they often do when I use the phone without the headset, so I assume quality is better than my phone's mic.

Now the problem, which I found out two weeks after the warranty expired.  I kept the battery pretty full the whole time I had it, charging regularly even if not used. Except the last two months or so when I didn't use it or charge it at all.  The battery seems to have run completely down or really low and now it will not charge no matter how long I leave it on the charger, and will not turn on.  The red led will flash when plugged in which is the low battery indication.  Been that way for a day now.  Looking at the forums at Jawbone's website, this problem seems to start when the Icon needs charging, and I assume charging from a really drained state.  There are instructions to try to reset the Icon by holding the talk button while plugging and then releasing, but that didn't work for me, and I can't warranty it now.  Pretty disappointed since my 5 or 6 year old Motorola headset still works, although with a terrible battery life.

I will try another brand as noise assassin is a great feature, but if the headset doesn't block out noise on this end, it doesn't matter if the other party can hear.  Also, paying $50 to $100 every year is not appealing so Jawbone gets a pass this next buy.","Don't let batteries run down, died just after the warranty expired,",1316304000,2.0,,

I've only used dry-install shields in the past, and there's a reason why you get 3 in a pack:  you will screw up trying to align properly and inevitably get fingerprints or dust beneath the shield, then in frustration rip it off and start with a new one. This Skinomi shield makes install easier:  because you spray down the shield, you can actually move it around once it's on the iPad and place it perfectly around the cut outs.

I've only installed the front at the moment, and it looks perfect.  The trick is to carefully squeegee after installation, trying to get the bigger bubbles out and letting it dry for a few minutes. At that point you will see bubbles you might have missed, so I carefully squeegeed those bubbles out (it helps if you rewet the surface of the shield so that the little plastic squeegee glides easier). That got rid of most bubbles. You will see streaks, those do not squeegee out, it takes an overnighter for them to evaporate out.

So my shield not looks really nice.  So why one star off?  The top is a little more rubbery than I am used to, so sometimes my nail digs in a bit, but that's a minor complaint. As well, the black cleaning cloth they give you actually can shed a little bit, and on a white iPad it did peace a black speck or two under the shield right against the white border, making it very visible. You then have to rewet your fingers, lift up the shield, and try to scrape that off the shield. Luckily, wetting your fingers mean that no fingerprints will deposit, so it worked out. But if you have a white iPad, find a white microfiber cloth to clean the screen before install.  Or be more careful in ensuring that no black specks are present.

I ordered these a few weeks ago and only got two screen protectors instead of three.  I left a review, stating that I got two instead of three and gave it a three star rating.  Not too big of a deal, didn't really care, and called amazon.com to let them know they might want to check other orders or customer's just to see if it's a big problem.  Didn't want anything out of it.  Didn't even want to contact the seller of the item.  Well, about 15-20 minutes later the seller called me on my phone and asked if they could send me another three pack free of charge.  Fantastic!  One caveat was that I had to take off my review.  I told the nice lady on the phone I will not take it off but I'll change it to a positive one.  They even went as far as sending me an email about how to take my review down.

Fast forward to today, I get the new pack, it has three screens in it and I'm excited!  Let me go change my review!  Now, let me also say, no I don't actually know if I can change it but I know I can update and add to them but come to find out, the review was taken down by somebody other than me.  First off, I'll be happy to update obviously, it was great customer service but whoever took my review down didn't have my permission or at the very least didn't say, ""hey we're taking your initial review down.""  It makes sense to wait until I got the new order to update the review doesn't it?  I find it pretty dirty to just take it down period.  I'm not on anybody's time frame except for mine.

Product review: great screen protectors, awesome price, shipping was on par with the usual time frame.  All things considered this is the only bad transaction I've ever had with Amazon.  I give whoever took my review down 1 star and say this, that's pretty underhanded because I know why it was done.  None of my other reviews have been taken off amazon.

The display is as amazing as everything Samsung has made with Super AMOLED. The screen is large enough for entertainment as well as spreadsheets. Movies look fantastic. I am not much of a gamer but Riptide GP is pretty cool on the big screen.

The phone fits well in one hand and the included Swype input makes emails and SMS a breeze. It does seem a bit large when you hold it up to your head but who gets phone calls anymore anyway.

The 2500mAh battery isn't quite enough for all day use for an abuser such as myself but the phone charges with a micro USB cable and I hope to see spare batteries for sale soon.

I pulled the stylus out once to play with the included drawing app. I don't know that I will find much use for it but it's there if I ever feel like getting creative.

First is the micro-USB hood.  The metal shroud is made from a soft steel with a high-ductility (bendability).  Maybe because of this or maybe because of material selection in the contacts or something else, but the contact is intermittent.  When plugged into a computer if you touch the phone of cable, the USB connection drops and reconnects or just drops.  I tried to fix this by bending the shroud with my fingernail.  I CANNOT bend the shroud on other USB cables I own.

Second is the connection between the choke coil and Micro-USB end.  Since this area of the cable is one that gets bent the most, like when trying to keep the tip connected in your phone, the wires are getting brittle (starting to fatigue).  Ultimately, as this part is bent over and over, it will eventually break the small wires in the cable and that's all she wrote.  From how quickly it is happening, I can tell the manufacturer selected the wire based on cost versus longevity.  Oh well, that's how I bought the cable so I guess it proves the old adage.

The clamp works well on my HTC Thunderbolt Android phone, older HP standalone GPS, and a 5"" Samsung Galaxy media player. The 5"" player looks to be the maximum size for the jaw - certainly a 7"" tablet won't fit in there.

I was able to drive with the 5"" Samsung unit clamped in the jaw in normal surface street traffic and the unit didn't move at all. You might have to have your device offset to one side so the ""jaws"" of the clamp don't hold down a button.

Normally you don't want to leave an item like this out (it would attract thieves) and so the silicon pad won't leave a permanent mark on the dash. It does fit into my glovebox but it's a little bulky. I kept the plastic covering the pad so I can stick it back on there and keep the silicone clean.

The only quibble I have is that the bottom of the unit won't stay flat - it looks like it's sort of puffed up, so the edges of the unit don't sit flat on the dash.

Since I have always carried my mobile phones on my belt, keeping the tradition was a no-brainer. After reading all the good review on the Grantwood QuickFlipCase, I decided to get one.

I was very impressed with the quality of the product. I got the bumper edition since I knew I was going to have a Belkin silicone cover as well. After 3 weeks of using the holster, I couldn't be more please with my decision. I would recommend this product for anyone wanting a quality product at a great price.

UPDATE:
I purchased this well-made case about 11 months ago. At that time, the case was made with a leather covered spring clip with a metal tip. Using the case on a daily basis, clipping on a belt and then clipping off, the stitching around the metal clip came off. This exposed the metal clip and caused it to scuff and scratch the belt.

I contacted Grantwood through e-mail about the problem. They responded quickly and offered to send an immediate replacement. Within two days of my reply, a new case arrived at my door. It had a redesign clip made out of plastic and I'm hoping that it will last at least as long as the previous design.

There have been comments about the magnets which are used on the case flap and the possibility that they might interfere with the iPhone electronics. Over the 11 months that I've had the case, I have not experienced any interference that I can determine. Phone calls and e-mails come in as expected.

In reading some of the reviews, it appears that there have been a few varieties of clips; the metal covered spring clip of my original case, a redesigned lightweight plastic clip, and a redesigned heavier weight plastic clip. When you have a product made for you, you try to develop the best design. I believe that since the clip design has gone through several iterations, Grantwood has listened to its customers and tried to design a clip that would meet its customer's expectations.

Here's an example: If I plug my phone into this charger it starts charging and everything is fine. If I then also plug in my iPad to the second PowerBlock jack, the iPad doesn't acknowledge the charger at all. If I then unplug the phone the iPad will display ""Not Charging"" which means the PowerBlock is powering the iPad but the iPad doesn't think there's enough power available to also charge the battery. But... it turn out this is all just Apple being a Steve Jobs monopoly.

If I reverse the order of things, and plug the iPad in first, and the phone second, both happily charge nicely! So the issue isn't that the Griffin PowerBlock can't deliver enough power. It's how Apple has programmed the iPad. My Android phone, regardless, is always happy with the PowerBlock.

I suspect the above weirdness is not the fault of the Griffin PowerBlock, but the way Apple implemented charging on the iPad. Apple, of course, wants you to ideally only use APPLE accessories.

The seller was very good with communicating and sending tracking information.  The case arrived on time within the time frame allowed by Amazon.  Packaging was good as well.

Case:

1) Size: the size of the case is actually the same size as other cases that I have for the Droid but when you look at it the case seems bigger.  Visually it seems to look bigger.  However, it fits the Droid snug and there are elastic sides to accomodate any pressure.  The Droid will fit nicely as it is but will not fit if you have a protective case already on it.

2) Material: the material used for this case is genuine leather.  Inside and out the case is leather.  Black on the outside and tan on the inside.  Very nice quality - does not look cheap at all.  Very high end for the price. It should protect the Droid with the soft leather inside and not scuff it.

3) Flap: to get the Droid in and out of this case there is a flap system with a magnet inside it.  This works very well and compared to others that I have it is easy to get the phone in and out quietly.  Some velcro flaps make a RIP! noise but that is how velcro is.  The magnet DOES NOT effect your phone as other reviewers state.  I purposly tried to have the magnet activate the phone docking mode by moving the phone all over the case.  It didn't happen.  Normal use of the case with the phone facing out or towards you will work fine and the magnet will not do anything to your phone.

4) Clip: there is a metal clip for your belt as well as two loops on either side of the belt clip for sliding your belt through for a more secure attachment to your waist.  The clip works well for me and if needed you can slide the case up and down to adjust it on your waist.  Don't get me wrong the belt clip holds tight so the belt loops are not really needed but nice to have just in case I need the secure attachment.

5) Notes: I liked the fact that the case has leather inside.  Some of the other cases I have had left an imprint on the screen protector that I have because the insides of the case are nylon.  However, believe it or not this leather case did make an imprint on my screen as well.  I wonder if it is the type of screen protector I am using (BodyGaurdz) becuase I have gone through six of them!  Once the imprint is on the screen it won't come off.  Like I state in other reviews, having the screen facing towards you works better when removing the phone from the case but increases the potential of 'screen imprint' hapening.  The reason being there is more pressure on the screen when it is in the case facing towards you.  So face it out, away from you, even though it makes it awkward when inserting and removing the phone.  Bottom line for the money ($0.1) this is a quality case and should last a very long time yet continue to look stylish.  Best of luck to you!

UPDATE: (One year later)
Well the case has held up nicely and is my main case.  There are no problems with the battery at all.  The imprint I mentioned in my review went away - it is the screen protector that does it.  My Droid is two years old now and still looks like I just bought it yesterday thanks to the protection of this case.  Also, the belt clip is intact and still firm.

Its made worse by the fact that my phone is encrypted and I am very security conscious so I always use the power button also to lock the phone after using.  i was never able to get used to the force required which really is extreme.

The instructions that come with the battery are clear about the method of conditioning the battery, I've followed them to the letter. The instructions are to not charge the battery when you receive it but instead to put it in and let the battery drain to 0 and then charge it using the wall charger. For the next four charge cycles you should let the battery drain to 0 before recharging it.

The only down side of this battery, and all of the Quasimodo class batteries, is the hump on the back of the GN.

It's not very powerful, but at least it allows you to use most of what Android has to offer.  Gingerbread (Android 2.3) works well, with little lag.  Almost all of the basic apps work fine,  with only the newest ones giving the BLU any fits.  The 600mhz processor is just enough to allow for smooth day to day operations, and all the basics work fine.
Battery life is decent, with the BLU going a full day with moderate use.  Even with some heavy Angry Birds use,  I eeked out at least eight hours before it showed it needed charging. That's a good thing as I couldn't find an extended battery anywhere for this phone.
I've had some higher end Android phones before and paid quite a bit for them, but for the paltry sum of around $99.00 you honestly can't go wrong with this phone.  It even has a few tricks up its sleeve that the more expensive competition can't do, like having dual sim slots for your choice of either AT&T(the only way to get 3G in the USA on this phone)  or T-Mobile(limited to 2G, or EDGE, in the USA, not overseas, though).  Both can be used at the same time as well, nice.

I decided to look anyways since I really wanted a larger storage capacity for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I found a couple that interested me. One was a class 6 and this one which is a class 10. I then thought that A class 6 would work fine for me and it was about $40 less than this class 10. As I read reviews from both, they seemed to be equally good, but then I figured that I might as well go for this one which would help me transfer files, photos and music a little quicker. Also, the camera in the Galaxy S3 is great and it just made more sense to me to get the class 10 over the 6 which helps the camera in HD video and photos.
When I got the card I right away put it in the phone. I wanted to see if the phone recognized it right away or if I was going to first have to format it. The phone recognized the card immediately. It shows 59.8GB available. I then took out the card and inserted it in my laptop so I can transfer everything that I originally had on my older card. I was afraid after doing that the phone would have difficulty reading the card. Well, the card worked great.

(The USB cord that comes with it and also the original Apple cord work fine - you do need your own AC connector if you intend to plug it into an outlet instead of your computer.)

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a Flyer case that offered the same substantial physical and environmental protection (the Survivor claims to be rain-resistant for an hour), however, the Otterbox Defender seemed like a good alternative. The Otterbox Defender fits well, is very well made, and offers serious protection. While one of the reviews stated that the raised edge over the screen interferes with the usage of the stylus, I wasn't bothered by it. I think the best element of this case is actually the hard cover, since with it attached, I have no qualms about tossing the Flyer into a bag or backpack since I know the screen is fully protected. However, if I could re-design this case, I would get rid of the integrated stand in the cover to reduce weight and thickness, and I would improve the tactile feel of the buttons since you need to press pretty hard and they can feel mushy.

If you've never used a heavy-duty or rugged case before, the first thing to realize is that these cases add considerable weight and bulk to your device...and in the case of the Otterbox, it triples the thickness of the Flyer and adds ~3/4 of a pound when the cover is attached. The headphone jack area is covered by a silicone flap and is physically restricted by the plastic frame, so your AUX cable can't be too thick around the connector. Also, while the camera lens is covered by a clear membrane, this case is not designed to protect from water...the screen area is not sealed, and there are holes over the speakers and microphone.

First off, the volume and power/screen-on buttons are covered.  While you can use them, it requires a bit more force and you don't feel any type of feedback.  This may be more of a personal preference thing, but not being able to tell if you adjusted the volume in your pocket is annoying.

But more so, the cut-outs do not line up with the phone.  The bottom mic is covered because the hole is about 0.25"" off.  On top of that, good luck actually charging your phone.  Because it is off, the charger doesn't fully fit because part of the case gets in the way.  If you push really hard and get it just right, it will charge, but if you bump it, the charge stops.

The pros are so many that i really love this phone, is a minimonster capable of a lot of things, with a decent reception, a good browser (lacks pinch and zoom because of it's single touch capacitive screen), a good audio quality, and a lot of apps, keep in mind that if you like a really tiny phone you should buy this one, else look for the other xperias that can satisfy your needs of a big screen, and finally if you want this device as a gaming phone (gamboy, nes, snes) buy the xperia x10 mini pro, the keyboard will help you with this stuff",Little piece of technology,1304121600,40.0,,

First of all, mine is clearlly a 9020T, marked that way both on the package and under the battery cover.  As several other reviewers have mentioned, make sure that you order yours from Amazon LLC and not one of their other suppliers if you want to ensure you get a 9020T.  The display is absolutely beautiful and the phone feels more solid than I thought it would.  That said, I'm not thrilled with the pop-off battery cover - it seems fairly strong and I have to assume both Samsung and Google tested it.  Replacement covers are plentiful and reasonable on *-bay so I'm going to order a replacement just in case.  I'm also surprised and happy with how Samsung implemented the SIM card slot - I recently damaged another phone by using a micro-sim card adaptor.  The Nexus S is well designed in this regard and you don't have to worry about swapping out SIM cards.  Overall, I am 100% pleased with this phone so far and highly recommend it.

********************* Edited on 4 AUG 2011 to add update ***************************

No doubt about it - this is a wonderful phone - but I do want to add a couple of caveats.  First, at least with mine, it appears that I cannot charge the battery to 100% - it stops at 97%.  And, the battery life is pretty good but I do not think it will hold up for almost three days like the Nexus One.  Second, and I admit this is kinda minor - there aren't many highly-rated cases for it - and Otterbox does not yet make a case.  Still - with the incredible display and how fast it runs - it is the best phone I own and I'm thinking about getting a second one to use with my 3GS contract chip.",Great phone with fabulous display!!,1312243200,4.0,,

So far today (after charging overnight in my phone) my Samsung Note shows 88% battery level after 5 hours light usage.  This is as good, or slightly better than what I usually get from the original Samsung battery. The Samsung battery is rate 2500mAh, whereas the generic is 2600mAh, but the difference is insignificant.

The charger has a red light when charging and a blue light when charged, and the plug folds in for travel.  The charger will also charge your phone if you plug a cable (not included) into its usb output.  3 batteries are included and they appear well made.  The batteries are the same size as the original Samsung batteries, but are lighter in weight.  Samsung battery = 49.4 g; generic = 40.9 g.  I notice the Samsung battery has a metal jacket, whereas the generic has a plastic jacket, so this may be the difference.

When I ordered, Amazon warned me that shipping from Hong Kong could take 45 days, but the package arrived in only 2 weeks.  Packaging could have been improved since the item arrived in only a simple paper envelope.  I will update this review if I find any problems.

Update 5/7/12
I have had one of the generic batteries in my phone since 4/28/12 and it has been as good as the Samsung battery.  Watch out for battery apps!  I had a battery app that quickly drained my Samsung battery (I immediately uninstalled it) and by accident I installed it again, but now with the generic battery.  Same result: battery drained after 6 hours.

Update 5/23/12
No problems so far.  Other apps that have caused battery drainage problems for me are pedometer and compass apps.  I deleted them.

I have reset it several times, but the bluetooth just doesn't seem to be anywhere close to 20 feet for reception. If I put the phone in my front pockets the headset will lose connection, tell me there is no active phone connected, then 10 seconds later tell me there is an active phone connected. This is EXTREMELY annoying. Also if I hold the phone in my hand while walking or keep it in my pocket I hear lots of static. The only time this headset works perfectly is when I am in my car and the phone is on the seat next to me or at my desk and the phone is next to my keyboard. Anyother time I either get the no active phone message every 10 minutes or hear static. If I hold the phone up close to my head the static goes away when I am walking, which defeats the reason for a wireless headset. Keep in mind I have had this same issue on three devices, an HTC EVO and 2 different Palm phones with the same result. For $80 I would expect a much better performance.

This is the best bluetooth I have ever had. It pairs quickly and easily. The sound quality if fantastic when I listen to a caller or music. The people on the other line say I sound crystal clear. Much better than the 2 Jabras and motorola bluetooths I had before. Also very light and the earloop is great. One Jabra I owned the earloops were cheap and kept breaking. Everytime I called customer service they would send me packets of 3 for free, but it was still annoying.

My only con is that when I have been connected to my phone for a long while with no actions being taken the Q2 will tell me the connection to my phone is lost and then that the connection is re-established.

I've heard most people with smartphones complain about battery life. This tends to hold it's charge very well. I don't talk a lot on the phone and I don't text on a daily basis. Also, google syncs well although when you decide to stop syncing, it still does after a while for some reason. I've tried to remove the email account and the only way to do that is to factory reset so i let it be.

That said, this phone is slow for a smartphone. And this is my first but as time went on, it got progressively worse. I don't play games and I don't access fb through this. The apps i have are skype and finance tool and i got those when i first got the phone and i rarely use use them. I've used skype on the phone no more than 5 times. The memory isn't much but i got one of those amazonbasics micro sd cards so that isn't a problem.
The screen goes black just randomly even though i went to the settings to choose when i want it to go black. If i'm calling a company, by the time i'm done pressing 1 for such and such, it'll be black when i come to choose the next option.
I was on it this morning and it died.
Charged it but it wouldn't charge. Took battery out and put it back in and it came back on. Charged for a little bit and went out. Died 2hrs later and when i came back it will not charge.

It was great as an mp3 player but for the amount of money i paid for this, I was better off getting a regular sandisk player and $20 phone which is what i had prior to this and it worked well and was still working when i got this. Back to that i go.

UPDATE: I purchased this phone directly from amazon and NOT through a 3rd party seller and i called them about the warranty info and the customer service person i spoke to did not know the information about the warranty and asked me to call samsung international and ask what branch of samsung int'l is responsible for the warranty. And even when he offered to have me return the phone (after many holds and me getting irate), he couldn't tell me what refund I'll get. For anyone else who purchased through amazon, i found the warranty card and it's through Zeezoo. Their contact info is 1.954.570.3366 or 1.888.485.2355.

Update 11/30/12: I called Zezoo and they said to mail the phone in to see if they can fix it. They couldn't fix it so they offered me 3 phone options to chose from for replacement. I chose the galaxy y duos which is a newer phone and unlike this one, this replacement is the US version and received it yesterday. They were professional, courteous and surprisingly very easy to deal with. So I guess the warranty on amazon phones are good. The whole process took about 3weeks to send and receive replacement.

What some of the other reviewers have said is true: The stock ROM on this phone has problems with GPS and a few other things. When reviewed using stock ROM, I'd have to say this is a 3.5-star phone because of those issues, and Motorola's decision to ignore those problems.

Thankfully, the Android community doesn't let stuff like that go without fixing it, and so there are a few different custom ROMs to run on the Motorola Triumph. CM7 runs great, fixes the GPS issues, and grants all sorts of OS improvements that should have been there from the start. It does have some negatives, like taking time before they get around to implementing the HDMI port, and having minor issues with having both WiFi and Bluetooth running at the same time (major battery drain if you do this), but the gain in having a fully-working phone that can hit the GPS satellites, maintain call quality, make WiFi calls, do wireless tethering, and other improvements and upgrades is worth it, if you ask me.

With CM7 installed, the phone is stable and performs like it should have out of the box. It's a little tricky getting it installed, but once you do it you'll be happy you picked up a Motorola Triumph. Add to that the fact that you can still use Virgin Mobile's super-cheap thirty-five dollar monthly plan to get 300 talk minutes plus unlimited data and texts, and you've got a winner here.

After much research, I ordered this lens kit.  The package arrived professionally packed with a sealed bag of small tools and the lens packaged separately.  While there are no instructions, I followed those provided in some of the reviews here.

Installation took about 10 minutes.  After sealing the phone back up and powering it on, my photos look brand new!  This worked perfectly!  I wish I had ordered an extra one to have as a spare (in fact I recommend this so to pay for less shipping).

NOTE 1:  My lens did not have the protective covering film mentioned in other posts, and all the requisite tools (and then some) were included.

NOTE 2:  After opening the case, in order to remove the lens itself from the back case I recommend using the small flat head screwdrive, or guitar pick included, to dislodge the lens from the INSIDE of the case by prying/popping the black housing attached to the lens itself up from the case, instead of poking the lens from the OUTSIDE of the case.

I love it so far. The case has a smooth feel to it, not rubbery, but not glossy either. Perfect. It helps keep the phone from sliding around a bunch, but also allows it to easily slide into and out of pockets without turning your pocket inside out, or bringing all of your pocket lint with it.

Fit and finish is great. There are no large gaps, no sharp edges from poor molding processes, etc. The case goes on snug, and fits perfect. It was difficult to get it installed properly the first time, because the acrylic outer layer did not line up with the features on the silicone, and it took me an extra 2 minutes to get it right. Once I did though, I was completely satisfied. Fits GREAT.

Haven't put it to the drop test yet, thankfully. The case does seem rigid enough to protect the phone adequately without being overly bulky or obtrusive.

Overall, I think its a win. The case is also pretty stylish in my opinion, and actually looks/feels better than the naked Thunderbolt.

I hope it protects my Thunderbolt for a long time to come. When I do update to a new phone, the Incipio Silicrylic will be the first case that I buy.","High quality, stylish case!",1329177600,5.0,,

The phone fits snugly into the gel skin and the outer shell. One of my main concerns with the SG3 was dropping it due to the slick back cover of the phone. I usually carry my phones in a slip case such as a Proporta that contains a sheet of aluminum in the case to help protect the screen from damage. With the SG3 I don't have this concern since the screen is made up of Gorilla Glass and is incredibly resistant to not only scratches but to damage during normal, daily use.
I was also concerned that the outer corners would be large and cumbersome but they are actually relatively small but protrude enough where I think they will help absorb some of the shock should the phone be dropped on a hard surface.
I have a few other cases that I have purchased and that I will be returning since the Balistic case does work so well. One of the complaints I have with the other cases is that they interfere with the use of the ""home"" button on the phone. Since the ""home"" button is so close to the edge of the phone any type of case that has a large lip near it will hinder normal use. In the case of the Balistic design this is  not an issue.

This protector still wasn't designed for the Xoom - the cutouts just don't make sense (if it's for the Camera LED, then why not a cut out for the notification light or the charging light?, if it's a cut out for the mic it's in a very bad place because the mic is on the bottom of the Xoom), as well it doesn't cover 100% of the screen. To the point where you can't align the screen protector using a corner, you have to line it up with the front facing camera, if it was made to fit you'd be able to align one corner and the cut out for the camera would automatically be in place.

All that being said, it realistically covers enough of the screen to be a viable protector, especially if you're using the gel case that comes around the front a bit. And I have to say after the ""abuse"" I had put it through, it does hold up well. I'm not 100% happy with the purchase but it has to be noted how well Skinomi handled themselves and if you're not as OCD as I am, this will probably be great for you.

One last closing note, another reviewer mentioned a YouTube with installation tips on this item, that YouTube showed the installer spraying the heck out of the protector and even on the screen of the Xoom - while the directions (and emailing with Skinomi) tells you to only use a light even layer. It was 10X easier to install using a lot of the solution as opposed to a ""light even layer.""

My earlier review was somewhat harsh and was a culmination of frustration from: the protector not covering 100% of the screen, the 3 cut outs and the non disclosed lengthy installation time. I have removed it and just hope if you're reading this and planning on buying it (which is an OK idea) that you: a) use a lot of solution b) can wait for it to be fully ""cured"" before the screen looks good again and c) use a gel cover or another type of case that comes around the front of the Xoom so it's 100% covered.",OK (updated),1299024000,8.0,,

I always thought that people who walked around with a bluetooth in their ear looked crazy. No offense. I decided I'd be Bluetooth free until one day I almost rear-ended someone trying to switch my phone to speaker while having a conversation. That was the wake-up call I needed.

It was super easy to connect the Motorola H720 Bluetooth to my Droid 2. The sound is crisp. I have no problems hearing the person I talking to and they have no problems hearing me. There's a volume control on the side of the bluetooth that's a little difficult to adjust. On accident, I discovered I could control the ear volume using my phone which is what I now do.

The button in the middle is to answer and hang-up. With just one touch I can answer a call. No fiddling around trying to find the button. It's the perfect size and doesn't require a heavy hand to activate it.

The battery life is phenomenal. I've only charged it once since I bought it. Granted, I don't talk on the phone a lot and I only charged it because I was getting paranoid that the battery was going to die on me even though there was no indication that it was.

The earpiece is comfortable. It's very light and sometimes I forget that I'm wearing it. My only complaint is that it's kind of big for my ear (I guess I have small ears) so instead of sitting snug against my head, it kinda dangles a little.

Postives:

1. It seems well made and all the openings are in the right places.

2. It helps grip the phone better.  The Motorola Attrix is so slippery that you have to have a case to avoid dropping it.

3. It was only ten bucks.

Negatives:

1. The case is very bulky.  The silicon skin has little waffles on the inside and texture on the outside; which makes it twice as thick as regular silicon skin cases.  The end result is it makes the phone almost a 1/4-inch thicker, wider and longer.  So much for the thin form factor.  It's so thick that it feels like I have 2 phones in my pocket now.  The waffles probably will protect the phone a little more than a standard silicon case.

2. The silicon skin is just like any other.  Has a greasy feel and is a lint magnet.  After a day of use, the black case is now gray and cover with pocket lint.

3. Just like other silicon cases, it pulls the pocket liner out of your pants when you reach in to get your phone.  The huge size of this thing makes this problem worse.

Unfortunately, there are only 3 cases available on Amazon.com for the Motorola Attrix right now so I'm stuck with this until better ones become available.

April 2011 Follow-up (downgraded to 1 star.  Would select 0 star if that was an option):

Used this case for over a month now.  It has degraded.  The rubber or silicon body has softened and stretched.  It is so loose that the phone will slip out of the case if you grip it wrong.  The finger print scanner seldom works anymore because when I swipe my fingers, the ""stretched"" case will shift and partially cover the lens so it doesn't read my fingerprint.  I finally gave up and brought another case (High Gloss Black Flexible TPU Case for Motorola Atrix 4G); which was under $5 (including shipping!) and fit very nicely.  The TPU case is much thinner and looks great.  This Otterbox case is now garbage since the seller won't take it back.  Last time I ever buy an Otterbox case again.

When I saw a refurbished icon up for grabs for $35 (shipped!!!) it was a no brainer.  Given the options currently out at my time of purchase it was either $100 for the Era or this.. the Era adds another processor and an acceloramater... neither of which I need. I still get the great features like using the android app and the great customizing options from the jawbone.com site and a sleek top notch headset.

I love this thing, it's very small (that's a plus and a minus), light, plenty of attachment options (ear hook or no, and about 5 or 6 different bud sizes).  The one button function is a blessing and a curse.  No complicated dials or buttons to fool with just one large easily press-able button.  Now, one feature I was looking for was a2dp which allows me to stream music over bluetooth to my headset, which the jawbone does have.  HOWEVER, because the jawbone only has one button it does not support AVRCP which allows you to play, pause, ff or rw from the headset.. I have to do all of that from the device.  No big deal really for me, but a heads up for anyone where this might be a deal breaker.

The sound is a bit tinny to my ear, though I'm guessing that's because of the shape of my ear, the speaker won't point directly into my ear or something.  I have found an earplug combo that fixes this mostly though but given that I do listen to music/podcasts with this thing, I have to admit this will not be a replacement for my dedicated headphones.  I've had other mono bluetooth headsets do a much better job (plantronics and jabra have good ones.. but I lost one and broke the other).  I called my wife after I got it and tested the noise assasin.  She definitely heard noise reduction (I had the windows down and the radio up) but was still able to hear the radio clearly with NA on so don't expect to wear this at a concert and expect your caller to hear a pin drop, but it's definitely better than other noise cancelling headsets.

Overall I'm happy with my purchase.  It's a refurb so I expected to put up with a glitch or two (something cosmetic or some minor audio issue) but so far nothing has presented itself.  Would I have paid 100 for this?  Probably not.. the lack of AVRCP reduces the value for me, but i would have paid $50 or $60... instead I paid $35.  Winning.

I went without screen protection on my iphone4 for a while, because it was in an Otterbox. When I took the OB off, I realized the case itself had left impressions on the glass. My screen looks nice, but there are tiny signs of wear.

When I bought the iPhone 4s, I decided to protect the screen and back glass. I'll use a 3M product on the back glass, but on the screen it's Moshi all the way. The protection is so easy to apply, doesn't get pushed up by my Speck Candyshell case, and wipes clean. I have had no problems like others mention of the screen popping off or peeling loose.

Update: August 2012-
I replaced my iPhone yesterday, and the tech said he didn't have a way to save my screen protector. I picked up my Moshi right off of my old phone and placed it onto the new phone without incident. He was shocked. The screen protector is working as well now as it did from day one on the old phone.

If you have a screen protector on it, there's going to be a 95% chance the slider is going to cause it to bubble. I think that's why Incase charges $20 for their custom fit screen protectors which fits the screen area with the case on.

A+ for presentation and could be a very good gift for someone special. Unit came pre-charged but follow instructions... charge it for a minute or so before use. After that, it's as simple as plug it in. Fast charged my HTC EVO 4G from almost empty to full in a very short time... sorry forgot to time the charging time because I was overly excited over this new toy. After that I charged it using an AC-USB charger until all 5 green LED's are lit. Concept: Neat and Concise. The battery extender could also be charged by a computer via its USB cable. Then the same USB cable could be flipped over to charge the phone; in my case, I had to use an additional mini USB to micro USB charging adapter. So 1 cable, 1 bat-ext, 1 adapter, all in a single pouch. A+ for compact. A+ for simplicity and nice touch on the little status button that tells you how much juice is left. Industrial Design: Clean line and 'Apple' like although the enclosure squeaks a little when it's being squeeze. And because of the shining effect, expect fingerprints magnet! Buff the prints off using the soft case, and it looks marvelous! Overall, well built and no gap, which show excellent workmanship and attention to details. Markings are sharp and no blemish found. Don't know about how safe it is as there is no UL Listing Mark on it; could be a concern for a rechargeable Li-Ion battery, which is known to go 'Kaboom' when being over-charged. Has some weight feel to it...feel like it's stocky! Good, I am expecting beefy juice out of this bad boy!

Since it's full charge 8 days ago, it now has lost one green LED without being used. Assuming that the unit discharges linearly, it would take 8*5=40 days to completely discharge... Recognizing that this a false assumption and theoretically at best, so don't go jumping all over me now! I will give the unit another 8 days to check if it would lose another LED. Then loading and cycling tests of the unit will begin. Stay tune.

I love the fact that this charger comes with different interchangeable tips for any phone that you may need to charge. It even comes with the Apple tip!

With my first ever charge, I tested my sister's Samsung Android smart phone. Starting from 10%, it was able to fully charge within 1 hour and 20 mins. After that charging session, the the blue light indicator showed that I had 3 light left.
The next phone I tested was my own iPhone. I made sure to fully drain my battery (o%). Once I hooked it up to the Incredicharge, it immediately started to power up my phone with the Apple logo. Within 1 minute, my phone was able to turn on with 2% charging on the phone's indicator. I let it fully charge and it took approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes. After that session, theere was still 2 blue lights left off this charger.

For T9 the onscreen keyboard is great, for QWERTY its passable but not as good as iPhone or Droid.

The S60 OS this phone runs lacks some of the coolness of the new smartphone OS's like the iPhone, android or maemo. But the upside is you get a lot more control of the phone via its settings. If you've not had an S60 phone the learning curve can be a bit steep but once you learn it you can really fit the phone nicely to your needs.

Were it possible, I would have rated the smaller-sized 4.5, only because of its somewhat limited screen coverage. But pressed to choose, 5 stars is more accurate than 4, especially for prospective buyers aware of the coverage issue. DBA Cases provides an ample quantity of the ""wet"" in a spray container. Although I had a little bit of difficulty pressing down on the top of the container to make it spray, the installation process was quick and painless with excellent results.

It's hard to tell the protector is on, even when the screen is off. It just disappears with the screen on; it has great clarity. Also, it feels smoother than the bare glass of my iPad 2. ""Just Like Glass"" may be an understatement in that respect. Altogether, it seems a quality product.

The test model leaves a margin of about 1/8 of an inch. At the top it has cut outs for the speaker and camera. At the bottom there's a cut-out for the button. It's been installed for 4+ days. So, far I've not noticed any problem from the proximity and light sensors being covered. But then I don't really know how I would test for any problems. Regarding installation, I appreciate the fact that a larger spray container was provided. Perhaps because it was taller, I found it much easier to use than the regular spray container. Unfortunately, I did not do nearly as good an installation job on the test model as I did on the regular one. Some of this may be attributable to my not having installed a wet screen protector before. The ZAGG on my Samsung Vibrant was installed at the mall stand where I bought it. But I also think that the added length and cut-outs made it more difficult to install than the shorter, squarer production model. The result is that, there are noticeable circular areas when the screen is off, some of which so far have not entirely disappeared when the screen is on. If the problems do not resolve themselves, I may install the second of the two regular-sized proctors that I bought from Amazon before being chosen to test the larger-size protector.

I installed the current model Just Like Glass screen protector on an S III with a ZooGue case. There's no overlap between the case and the protector, so no concern about interference or peeling. Nor is there any concern about the larger protector peeling. I installed it on an S III with the DBA Cases Ultra Complete case. For both installations, I first removed the case.

My initial impressions favored the other case, for about 2 days. (It was slightly grippier, but I got fed up with unpressable buttons, misaligned ports, etc.) I put this case on again and haven't looked back.

This is no armored tank of a case, so if you are exceptionally hard on your devices you should definitely check out the (bulkier and more expensive) items from other vendors. If you are reasonably careful it will protect very well against scratches and minor drops. (I recently hopped out of the jeep with the phone on my lap, tossing it about 4' to the asphalt. The case got a minor scuff, but the phone is completely fine!) It also has a lip around the edge of the screen to protect the screen and bezel when you set it screen-side down on a table or other reasonably flat surface. The galaxy still feels just as slim and fancy as without the case, which is something I really missed on my last phone (a G2X in an armored box.)

My main desire was to add some grip and body protection to the phone so that I could stop worrying about accidentally flinging it across the room or dropping it somewhere unfortunate, and the case took care of that with flying colors.

Pros & Cons:
- Protection that can't be beat in a custom phone case (Otterbox universal case protects better but I'd only use that if I planned on taking my phone swimming with me).
- If you want maximum protection from foreign particles entering the case, you'll need to install the camera lense protector yourself, making a small modification to avoid degraded flash photography.
- Adds bulk (as does any protective case), but it actually makes the phone easier to hold.  The bulge on the back/bottom of the case is an improvement over the actual phone's design.

I had never heard of this product until I began my quest for the perfect Droid X case.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  My only concern prior to receiving the product was the screen protector.  I'm EXTREMELY particular about the screen (one of those guys who can't stand a microscopic bubble or spec of dust under the screen protector). When I put the Kraken on my Droid X, I wasn't happy the built in screen protector initially...but when I removed the Invisible Shield protector I had previously installed on my phone screen, I'm very impressed.  The display is as responsive and clear as it was with nothing on it.  Nice!  The case comes with an clear protector for the camera & flash also, but it's up to you whether to install it; I chose to install it for maximum protection.  The first few photos I took with flash after that were washed out. I suspected the flash was reflecting off of the protective film inside the case, into the lens.  So, put two small strips of black electrical tape (1 mm wide) between the flash & lens - one strip on the phone itself, the other on the protective film inside the case.

I did a lot of research on products that could fit the bill and the item that had the best reviews and performance just so happened to be the New Trent Arcadia Pack IMP70D. While I could have purchased other products, the New Trent Acadia Pack had reviews touting its usefulness and reliability; this product did not disappoint.

I had previously considered buying a phone external battery pack from a different company until I found out that the New Trent battery pack could charge all my other devices as well. This means I can throw it in my backpack or purse and charge my Android phone, Asus Transformer, Asus Transformer Keyboard and just about anything else I need charged. The perfect accessory for a student on the go! There are even different ports so that I can charge my phone (1A) or tablet (2.1A). When I showed this product to my friends, they were all pretty impressed by the versatility of this product. One product is able to charge a variety of devices, which makes it an important accessory to have if you carry around the latest electronics. I usually use it with my phone and I find that I can charge my phone (HTC Amaze, aka the battery vampire) five times without having to recharge the New Trent battery pack. With my use, I charge it once a week at most.

The only flaws are not really flaws of the product. This battery pack requires that you remember to bring your charging cables with you. I've waltzed right out the door with the charger but forgot the cord... doh! It's become more of a habit for me to bring the cords nowadays. Also, it would be cool if the IMP70D had some sort of nubs to wrap my cords around it to make the pack even more convenient, but this is also not an issue of the product.

However, the case does not allow easy access to the vibrate/sound side switch. It is nearly impossible to reach it while the case is on because it does not align properly. Because this is a feature I use often, I was extremely disappointed by this.

The plastic that covers the sensor of the iPhone prevents the keypad from disappearing during phone calls. This results in buttons being pressed, or calls being disconnected, by your cheek.

The case is constructed in such a way that the charging port does not allow for any other charging cable to be used other than the one that came with the phone. I can not use a car charger while this case is on. Because I charge my phone whenever I can, this is a huge issue for me.

Lastly, the case is extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY difficult to get off once it is snapped into place. My fingers were sore and nearly bruised after trying to remove this case. (It's not just because I am a weak girl either, my (very beefy!) boyfriend had lots of trouble too!)

LG sells the Spectrum extended battery (without charger) that needs a different back cover for double the price of this product, and they also sell a couple different types of chargers, but they didn't have a basic charger+battery combo like this one.  Anyway, it takes a few hours to completely charge the batteries, but the additional 2 batteries means they I never have to worry about having a dead phone...ever!  Also, this charger is essentially universal because the charger dock can pull open to fit different size batteries, and the battery contacts can be adjusted into almost any position. It's completely compatible with the factory LG battery that came with my Spectrum.

I will admit that the charger itself is not very fancy.  It's very light and made of basic plastic, but it works flawlessly and that's all that matters to me.  The batteries (aside from the white Hyperion label) look, feel, and perform identical to the factory LG battery. In fact, I think they last a little longer because they are 1900 mAh, and the LG battery is 1830 mAh.  You can't beat this deal for $25.

First, the connector itself kind of snaps into place.  When I pushed it down firmly, it had a light click at one point.  And secondly the cord channel has holders that keep it in place if you push it in there completely.  So push the connector all the way down hard, wrap the cord tightly through the channel, and push it into the locking grips.  Then it won't slide and let the cable come out.  I inserted and removed the phone a dozen times and it didn't come out.

The headphone connector is neat, and flips down if you don't want to use it.  I don't, so I'm glad it won't be in the phone which would mute it.

Almost all the cutouts are perfectly aligned, aside from the microphone (not perfectly centered but no issue with making calls). It is nice and rigid and I feel it would protect the phone from any falls that you may encounter in any non extreme situation.

I had their case for the HTC Thunderbolt and it lasted about 1.5 years before it broke at the microusb port area. The cutout for the usb and the kickstand made a narrow weak area that was subject to any stress from the usb cord. I don't suspect the S3's case will suffer from this as it does not have a kickstand and I can see it lasting 2 or more years, easily.

It has a matte finish that is a little more slippery than I would like but it resists prints and slides easily in and out of pockets. While not thin like a case-mate barely there, I think it provides substantially more protection and more importantly, covers all edges and corners. There exists enough of a lip to protect the phone when it is laying face down. All in all, the S3 with the case on has about the same thickness as my naked thunderbolt.

I have to say that this is the ideal case to me, the perfect compromise between slimness and protection. Something like an otterbox is overkill and the casemate, inadequate. I tried a Diztronic TPU case as well. It was well made and probably offers enough protection for most situations but I feel more at ease with this hard case.

The Navigation Edition is the same hardware. The only difference is cosmetics (matte black with chrome trim around the screen for the Navi, gloss black with a silver stripe on the side for the XM).

The Navi used to have the advantage of free Navigation, but Nokia now offers free worldwide walk & drive voice guided navigation on many of their phones, including the 5800 XpressMusic.

Which means the only real advantage of the Navi is that it also includes a car charger and a nice suction cup type car mount. If you want one of these 5800 phones, buy whichever model is cheaper, which is usually the XM, unless you feel the car charger & mount are worth extra. Prices fluctuate, so sometimes the Navigation Edition can end up cheaper, and when that happens it's a real steal.

Nokia releases firmware updates pretty frequently (there have been 3 or 4 in the last year). The latest is firmware v51.2.007, which adds a lot of new homescreen functionality (like scrolling contacts bar & music player widgets). You'll likely want that free update if your phone doesn't already come with it.

So now on top of the other great features, you get free WORLDWIDE voice guided drive & walk navigation with free map updates that cover major cities in over 70 countries on either of the 5800 models (Navigation or XpressMusic) by just updating to the new Ovi Maps 3.03.",Free Nav for all 5800 models,1268438400,5.0,,
4.0,True,2010-04-25,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B001BZH2QI,{'Color:': ' White'},Andrea Polk,"I'm a 6-year T-Mobile customer. Why? Because frankly, I'm too scared to change! Really though, I have a $29 a month plan (Business 300) that is no longer offered - 300 whenever, unlimited weekends, 100 texts, which has worked well for my needs and budget.  Unfortunately all the handsets I've owned (Nokia and Motorola) have had terrible reception much of the time.  I was blaming T-Mobile until I got the Nokia E71 and I'm THRILLED with the call clarity! Both on my end and for the recipients of my calls, who say they can't tell I'm on my cell - 'a first'.

I purchased this item as a Gold Box deal after reading online reviews here and elsewhere, that gave it mostly glowing reviews.  I also liked that it would work on T-Mobile or ATT, which are both available in my area.  I had hopes of using T-Mobile's $10 a month add-on for 'unlimited web for phones' (previously called Web2Go.

Upon opening the box I was surprised to see that the size and thickness of the phone are almost identical to my iPod Touch.  Very pretty - sexy even - the phone has an easy to use keyboard (my first phone with this type) with raised keys.  I have small hands and didn't find it tough to punch in numbers or texts, but people with bigger fingers might. The keyboard is backlit, which is very helpful, but it's not very bright.  I bet there's a setting for that which I've not yet discovered though.

The documentation, a CD for the PC Sync suite from Nokia, an AC charger, earphone/microphone combo, white (slip-in style) case, battery, and phone are in the box. I also bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OtterBox-Commuter-Case-for-Nokia-E71x-Black/dp/B002LG2HK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OtterBox Commuter Case for Nokia E71x (Black)</a>&nbsp;to protect it.  This case takes away from the beauty of the phone, but gives a bit of added protection.  The Otterbox Defender series is even better, but more expensive.

Not being a big reader of directions, I tried to wade through the manuals anyway.  That was daunting.  There is a lot of info on this phone as it has a lot of functions! I found that after I swapped my SIM card from my previous T-Mobile phone and got to the home screen on the E71, I could press 'menu' and then 'help', and again 'help', to be where I wanted to be to learn about this device.

Some cool functions found on this phone and discussed in 'help':

-Adobe Reader
-Activation Keys
-Active Notes
-Barcode Reader... VERY unusual to find on a phone and very cool to save product info and compare prices.
-Dictionary
-Flash Player
-GPS
-Internet Radio
-Modem - you can connect this phone (assuming you have mobile web on it activated) to a laptop for example, and use it as a wireless modem.
-Net calls... it has a webcam built in.
-Printing... add a printer to sync with your device to print docs.
-Real Player
-Recorder
-Wireless keyboard...if you link it to your phone, you can use it!

A 'Tutorial' section is a available in the 'Help' section as well, with short animated videos on 'how-to'.  I like this area, but even with these helps... this phone has a lot to offer and a lot to learn.

The E71's build quality is excellent!  Metal housing makes a world of difference in the feel of the phone.  I expect it would add to the durability as well.  My Nokia 5300 with a hard case started cracking within months of light use, as have other plastic phones I've owned, so for me, this is a big deal.

Navigating the phones many functions is relatively easy, but yes, it takes time to get the hang of it.  Buttons for specific functions like email, 'home' and others are clearly marked.  The side of the phone has a mini-usb port and mini-SD card slot, covered by rubber inserts. Volume controls are on the opposite side of the phone and work easily and well.

The 3.2mp camera is better than previous phones I've owned and it does come with a flash, which is new to me on a camera phone. Images were blurry or 'cloudy' looking, until one reader of the review mentioned taking the plastic film off the lens. ""Duh!""  Usually I remember these things, but not this time.  Taking the film off the camera lens definitely makes for better pictures - clarity wise - however the color of the images taken indoors with the flash, tends to be a bit off. Not a huge deal as photo editing software takes care of a multitude of sins, but you probably wouldn't want this camera to be your only one.

Charging port is at the base of the phone, with the speaker and on/off at the top.  I noted the microphone is at the lower left-hand side of the phone.  This is great if you are right handed while making calls, but call quality seems to suffer just a bit when you switch to left-handed chats.  Microphone placement... who knew?!

The keypad does lock and the screen goes dark rather quickly.  Again, probably just a setting issue I've not yet discovered in my 3 days playing with it. I looked it up in the book how to 'unlock' - pressing two buttons - which while a pain, is no big deal either.

The screen is big enough for most things.  Not fantastic for viewing web content, but this isn't really a web-maximized phone either.  The OS alone should tell you that, and if you're looking for a multi-media phone, keep looking.  It will email, do basic web browsing, and open media files if you have the appropriate data plan.  I didn't want to pay for the $20-30 a month web plan, so I am trying out the $10 a month unlimited web plan for phones with TM right now.  While I have a very basic Facebook interface for example, it's nothing like you would see on your home computer.  It is however, handy to Google things, comparison shop while out and about, check weather, etc..., which is good enough for me.  **I have been told by some that T-Mobile may try and kick me off this $10 plan saying if I have a smartphone I need the more expensive one.  My time with T-Mobile would be cut short if this happens, and I'd be looking to switch to ATT, as for me, this would be simply a way for more cash without 3G!  T-Mobile does not have 3G to this phone, but the phone IS capable of it.

I was going to return this phone, but that was due more to T-Mobile issues rather than the phone. I love the clear call quality most of all and the easy texting. Admittedly, basic stuff. The internet, if available, also affords some nice things like email, Skype chat, Facebook, and Internet radio (too bad it's got that 2.5mm port versus the 3.5mm standard).

In conclusion, it's a really nice phone for the right user. Not the best for multi-media or taking pictures, but a quad-band phone that has exceptionally good call quality, nice speaker and keyboard, moves quickly through apps, has built-in GPS (no internet needed) and Wifi capable.  I really like it, which I can't say about many phones I've owned. So the only real problems I find with it are linked more to T-Mobile as a provider than the phone itself. Which leads me to the basic question: 'Is the money I paid for it even on sale, worth it?'  ""Probably... at least for me.""

I have had a full 24 hrs of using this phone with T-Mobile's 'unlimited web for phones' ($10 a month) add on. I lost it initially when T-Mobile figured out I'd switched phones.  I went back to their site and put in my old phone as the one I'm using, and so far, they've not cut off my internet service. While it's nowhere as fast as 3G, nor visually as 'wow' as the newest touch-screen phones with Android OS... it's the useful kick I needed to make me happy and at the right price.

Now I have a phone that has great voice quality, speedy bluetooth uploads (took some photos and got them to my desktop very quickly), easy texting, GPS (tried that today too, and had it plot some routes with great success), music player and other assorted goodies that for me, are really sweet!

I'll be keeping this phone and may end up adding more texts or more minutes to my phone plan simply because it's a joy to use.  Has held a good charge too, even with lots of web browsing, texting and playing music. I like it and would recommend it to the consumer who wants a feature packed phone, that while not the 'latest and greatest', does a damn good job at the things it was designed to do.

T-Mobile's Web2Go is called 'unlimited web for phones'.  I had added it (free for 1 month), but decided $10 was more than I wanted to pay for this basic stuff (not G3).  Today when I went to take it off, T-Mobile offered it for $5 a month, calling it ""Preferred Phone First Unlimited Web Only"".  I snagged it and upgraded to a non-contract extending plan: 'Even More Plus 500 Talk + Text' which is $39.95 a month.  Now I have unlimited text (video, IM, Photo, or text), unlimited weekends and evenings, unlimited web and 500 anytime minutes for $44.99 plus taxes.

I used to have a BlueAnt unit that was 2.5x price but not 2.5x better. So when I lost it, I wanted to replace it with something cheaper that still got the job done.

Nice things: ""quick pairing"" automatically every time it's turned on, the price (cheap!), slim/lightweight, easy to use buttons, and simple packaging (amazon free frustration packaging)

ok things: no adjustable ear-buds

The dealbreaker: The non-adjustable ear-hook.
I noticed that if I used my hand to hold/pin the headset closer to my ear/mouth, the caller had less trouble hearing me (the microphone is very sensitive to how close it is the mouth.)

The case isn't sticky but at the same time isn't slick.  The buttons work well through the case and I have had no problems with the camera.  The front of the case is raised slightly so you can lay it on its front and not have the screen laying on the surface.  I have no problems with any power cable connections either.  I had the phone on the counter and it fell off and bounced, I was scared the screen would be cracked but the case must have done its job because the phone was fine.

I have two complaints.  The first is that the headphone jack is a little small.  It works fine for my headphones but the cord I have to hook it in my car is a little big and doesn't plug in as well.  The other thing is that dust seems to build up at the edges, so I have to take the case off periodically to clean it.  It might be worth noting that I did not put the clear screen protector on, I have never cared for them as they usually impair function and I've never found them that useful.  You can't scratch glass that easy.

It is better at holding the tablet upright with the bottom correctly positioned than it is at holding the tablet on a typing angle with the bottom at the top but that hasn't bothered me very much.  One person in their review noted that with the case on your lap the cover just flaps around in the back and they are correct in this but once again this really hasn't bothered me.  They also said that the magnets that hold the cover closed are weak and the cover does not stay closed.  I have not had this problem.  The case closes satifactorily and stays closed. One problem I have noted is that with the case opened if you try to take a picture you have to make sure that the flap is not folded all of the way in the back or you will cover the camera. That's not such a big problem, however, because the Toshiba Thrive has such a poor camera it really isn't worth using.  I'll cover that when I review the Thrive.  I recently saw a cover for the Thrive that allows you to position the tablet in either landscape or portrait orientation.  It was considerably more money but I may have considered that if I had seen it when I made this purchase.  This case does not allow you to stand the tablet up in Portrait.  One other minor issue is that it is not easy to get to the USB or HDMI ports with the cover on.  It's just a very tight fit to get your fingers where they need to be to pry the cover off.  In summary though I would say that the case is a good one and can't be beat for the price.

Application is very simple, but a little of the white backing tends to stick to the film. It's easy enough to scratch off whilst installing it, though.

The instructions warn of some small bubbles initially. Many of them work their way out after a day or two & some smoothing. However, on both mine and my mate's Sensation, a few small bubbles remain. I guess, for this price & with 5 protectors, you get what you paid for.

Sensitivity is only slightly compromised. The worst part is that it has too much texture. It doesn't feel good. There is a slight rough feeling which sometimes catches my fingers - yes, even when clean.

I no longer use this protector because of the loss of response & especially the feeling. Fortunately, Sensation has gorilla glass and I use a PDAir case.

I am very familiar with Skinomi skins as I had one on my last 2 phones and I have recommended (and installed) them on many phones for friends and family.

It is important to know that many people who claim that a skin has bubbles under the skin is because they didn't follow proper directions.  There is no possible way that a bubble that appears under a skin can be the fault of the skin itself, it is always, 100% of the time the fault of the installer.

If you follow the directions on these skins properly, you will have a perfectly fitting skin every time.  Keep in mind that some bubbles immediately after installation are normal and they WILL work themselves out.  Cheaper, hard plastic skins won't do this.  If there is any bubble after you are done, it will always remain there.

Some people criticise Skinomi's because they give your screen a textured look after its done.  They show fingernail presses for quite a while after they're installed.  That is a result of the ""gel-like"" material that the Skinomi is made out of and is not a fault with your skin.  This look is totally normal, and if you don't like it, don't blame the skin, you just have a preference that differs from how this skin is designed to work.

All skins should be a tad bit (1-2mm) smaller than the actual screen of your phone.  If every skin went perfectly to the razors edge of your screen, it would get snagged easily and would start peeling.  I see reviews of people saying the skin is too small.  This is also intentional and is not a defect (unless of course the gap is more than 2mm).

The Skinomi skin is as good of a skin as you can buy, for a fraction of the price.  If you follow the directions, or have someone who is experienced in installing skins on a phone do it for you, you will be happy with the results and this skin should last you for the life of your phone.  You won't have to keep replacing it like you have to with other cheap skins.

Finally, there is one thing you should be aware of, that has bitten me once on a prior phone.  Because of the gel-like nature of the Skinomi skin, the screen can become slightly ""tacky"" when it gets warm.  So if you are in the habit of keeping your phone inside your pockets, your body heat may cause the screen to become ever so slightly tacky.  If you also keep money or other pieces of paper in that same pocket, the paper can become stuck to the screen if you leave it in there too long.  It will come off, but it may leave a residue behind that will last for a couple of days.  This is probably the only flaw I can possibly think of with these skins, but again, its due to how they're made, and I don't think that this should detract from all of the other great qualities of this product.

I decided to order 4 different cases and see which ones were the best knowing that some of them might not work out and I would have to order replacements for those and to get right one that each family member wanted.  But I wanted to see some samples, Amazon shipping is usually fast enough and all of the cases were between $9 and $13 so in the end it would still cost a lot less than the $150 that I would need to spend buying buying the $30+ cases at the stores.  This one was one of the winners and I ended up buying two more to cover the 3 white phone that we have.  The material is strong and I like the smooth glossy finish.  The kids usually like other cases with the matte finishes but I find that those usually either get dirty and can't be cleaned or the matte finish is really just a coating that rubs off in spots over time and look old and ragged.  It has been about a week and a half and these cases still look shiny and have not picked up scratches yet (I am sure thy will with how much our phones get dropped) but the material looks like it will hold up to abuse well.

I could nit pick about the size of the holes for the camera and for the volume buttons, they are kind of big.  But they are functional I don't think they open up such a big hole that it will allow for a lot of scratching of the case.  The one hole that I usually have the biggest problem with on cases is the headphone jack hole.  Some of the cheap aux cables that we have in the cars have big old fat connectors at the end of the cable that work fine when you don't have  a case on your phone but when you put a case on like this one they will not fit in the hole provided by the case and cannot get close enough to the phone to make a connection.  This case has a small hole around the headphone plug and as a result those big old fat cables will not work.  If you have an aux cable with a smaller connector it will work just fine.  There are plenty that you can buy on Amazon for a few dollars that will work with this case.

Regarding fit to the phone it is a snug fit but I think that is good.  If you want to put a thick plastic protector on the back of your phone to protect it from scratches you may have trouble getting this case on your phone since the fit is so tight.  I did have a little trouble getting the case on without ruining the front screen protectors. I have yet to find a snug fitting slider case that doesn't have a tendency to  get under the very edges of of the softer gel type screen protectors as you slide the case onto the phone and this one is no different.  If your screen protector is the soft kind that you apply with a solution and that protector is an exact fit (or you are not an expert and get it on exactly right) and goes to the very edge of your phone without any space around the edges then this case may catch on the protector as you slide it on and lift the edges.  But this is pretty normal for a slider.

I was skeptical but went ahead and ordered this signal booster. After receiving I plugged it in, in my basement home office, with the antennae inside an exterior window. The window is not even on the side of the house facing the cell tower. I then placed my Blackberry into the cradle and nearly immediately the signal went from none or one bar to 3 or 4 bars! I then tested with my Samsung i920 and it too went to four bars from only one. Both use Verizon by the way.
AUTO
Just this past weekend I brought the booster along in my car to a spot where Calls have always dropped. Even in this dead zone the booster helped enough to retain signal and allow a call to be placed. I also used the i920 as a hotspot for my iPad 2 in the parking lot of our daughter's dance class, which normally has low signal and only 1X service. But with the booster the service went to EV/3G and the data rates increased significantly.
I may order a second one to leave in the car.
Additional notes:
-  Given how good it works I do not plan to keep the cradle close to my head, but overall we are very happy with the performance and value of this product.
- For my office I was able to use an extension cable, previously used for a WiFi router, to move the antennae to the best location I could find, while keeping the cradle and cell phone within reaching distance. I also tried it with an old WiFi antennae - one of the longer ones (~12"") designed to boost wireless signals - and that may have yielded a slight increase, but I have no way to accurately measure.
- It does use peak USB voltage with consistency so I would not recommend the use of a laptop or PC USB port for continuous power (this usually causes a Windows machine to use much higher CPU). Plugging the USB power cable into a USB wall plug works just fine. I also plug that wall plug into a timer so that the booster is only on during the day when it is needed.","Wow, this thing really works!",1317772800,2.0,,

I think what finally did it in is that I always left it in my car and that's not a good thing when you live in Texas and summers get into the 100s. This one is just as good as my old one. It works perfectly - I've never had a problem pairing it with my work BlackBerry or with my personal iPhone.  I also like that you can simply flip the boom out and back in to turn it on or off instantly. A lot of bluetooth headsets have a button, and you're never quite sure if you really turned it off or not. With this one, there's no guessing.  If it's closed, it's off.  This also likely helps with the battery life because I am also very happy with that - I only have to charge it once every week or two.  One thing I don't like is the little ""startup sound"", but that's a minor annoyance that I circumvent by waiting a few seconds before I put it on after I flip it open.  I also don't like how teeny tiny the status light is -- sometimes its difficult to tell what the status is or what color the light is because it's so tiny. On previous models it was bigger and brighter, but they've really made it small on this one (about the size of a pin prick). But probably the biggest complaint I have about this and other headsets is you sometimes just can't get it loud enough. I assume the manufacturers want to protect themselves from people blaming them for their hearing loss, but it sure would be nice if I could crank the volume up on this sucker, especially when I'm going 70 MPH down the highway. Other than that, I am very happy with this headset, and if/when this one dies on me, I definitely plan on getting another Moto flip.

Pros:
o Long battery life
o Easy on/off
o Super easy to pair
o Small & light - easy to carry around and easy to wear
o Micro-USB charger makes it very compatible with other device charges

o Max volume is sometimes not loud enough in very noisy situations

I asked the company at first to make sure it works with my setup: I have a Canon t2i camera and a HVX200 camera. I got a quick response for the answer and after a week, I placed my order.

So, here's my experience with the prompter:

1. Setup
It took me a bit to figure out the instruction how to assemble the pieces together since the instruction with picture was done in b/w color, it was hard to figure out the 'bottom part' of the metal plate, if the curve area should face up or down, after 30 mins of monkeying around, I got it right.

The screws for the prompter were not as 'accomodating', when I got all the pieces screwed together, the screw head was still sticking out a bit. I figured it would be ok... Keep reading, I was wrong...

the Glass was good, the clothe that came with it is of a fabric that can easily attract animal hairs or foam, so I would suggest if you can, switch to a clothe typed that wouldn't be attraction prone.

2. setting it up with my DSLR T2i camera.
I was having a hard time to use the wing nuts to secure it to my tripod (which was a vivitar cheap tripod), the tripod's head screw was shorter, so it managed to secure it. When I screw the wing screw to the t2i, I had a hard time put my fingers between the top and bottom plate (it would be easier if you unscrew the prompter and do rescrew it back). then once I had the t2i on with the prompter, I realized it was wabbly.. Yeap, the screw was longer than the intended hole on the t2i. My thought, maybe I have to get a bolt cutter and cut it shorter, but then I realized, I can easily just get 1 or 2 washers and there, it secured.

HOWEVER, as mentioned, the screws that were used to put the prompter together doesn't stay flat on the surface, your camera would be a bit 'elevated' from the plate as it touches the screws' head.

Ipad was very much 'just flat laid' on the prompter, so if you 'hit a bump' the ipad may falls off, a easy solution: use velcro, tape one part of the velcro on the prompter and the other on back of your ipad case and viola! It is secured :)

2. Using it with the HVX200 and Manfrotto 351mvb2 with 501HDV head. Boy, this WAS a pain, because the prompter's screw's head was not flat with the plate, the quick release for the manfrotto 501hdv would NOT allow it to slide in. So I have to unscrew the top and bottom plates, put the quick release of the tripod on, secure it and then slide the quick release with the bottom plate back to the tripod, and then put the screws back to tighten up the top and bottom plates.

Oh and there is ONLY one hole you can use secure the tripod's quick release to, as the two plates washers to secure the screws are sticking out from the bottom, it is 'JUST about' made it to the corders of the Manfrotto 501hdv head... So you can ONLY tighten it in the 'middle' hole, and then.

Once the top and bottom plates are secured, you can then place the hvx200 on it, sort of secure it (the plate's screw heads gets into the way).

So that means, if I have to take this with me to location shoot, the best thing to do is bring a screwdriver and do the assembly on the stop. :)

Other then that, the prompter does work well. But the extra hassles doesn't warrant a 5",can be better,1344211200,26.0,,

The swipe features are also really nice and I've found this phone to be relatively easy to use. My Google contacts synced right up and within minutes the phone was ready to go. Tomorrow it's going back to Amazon.

Here's why:
-The phone runs hot. And not just a little warm, or a lot warm, it's hot. So hot it was uncomfortable and I tried to hold the phone by its sides when I used it.
-When charging, the phone got even hotter. I'm not joking when I'm saying it burned my hand. I'm wondering, now that the phone is packed and ready to go back, if my unit was defective. Because if a lot of people experienced this, they're either ignoring it or they don't know how unusual it is for a phone to get that hot.
-My Yahoo! mail wouldn't sync. I kept getting an error. I deleted the account and set it back up 4 times.
-The battery life is terrible. The first day it lasted almost 6 hours and I hooked it up for an hour, after which it lasted for another hour.
-The second day the battery lasted 5 hours. I was barely on it as I was busy and every time I checked the screen, my battery had dwindled another 15-20%. So when it got to 55%, I set it on my desk and walked away from it. Two hours later it was dead to world, in the middle of the afternoon.

Why this hard shell case?

Otterbox knows what they are doing.  Most hardshell case comes in 2 pieces for the EVO Shift, this is technically 3 pieces. There's the rubber that engulf the entire back part of the phone.  The rubber is set up in a way where it create a nice seal to prevent dust, lint, or the accidentally spillage that may occur.  I have dropped the phone from table height straight screen down onto hard tile, the piece that goes over the bezel of the screen came off.  Prior to this, I have had dropped my phone the same way and cracked the screen.  Luckily I have insurance, and got it taken care of.  Initially I thought there were going to be the same damage, fortunately the Otterbox protect my phone! Popped the bezel piece back on and it's like new again.

Pros/Cons:

-makes it slightly bulky (especially when put in pocket)
-rubber seal of earphone jack, charger port and power button and volume button is covered
-can be slippery and tricky when trying to slide the keyboard out (takes a few sliding to break it in)

She switched to VM, with the HTC Wildfire...soon after I joined her on VM in an attempt to become more independent from my parents.

The day I recieved it, I activated it, transfered my verizon number, rooted and flashed cyanogenmod onto it in less than 24 hours. The number transfer took less than an hour for mine and my GFs, the root took about a half hour. I had never even attempted flashing with my Incredible. With this phone, it was super easy but very nerve wrecking lol (thinking you bricked your brand new $100 phone). Now, with cyanogenmod, its 10x better than my incredible. CPU downclocking when its not in use saves TONS of battery, awesome screen effects, everything looks and runs very well. Going from a 1ghz snapdragon to this with cyanogenmod; the change is barely noticeable.

Phone : It doesnt have an FM radio. I wish it did cause I listen to the radio a lot. No camera flash either, meaning no flashlight app (I used this often on my incredible). Poor but acceptable quality camera. Physical keys can be annoying. Screen is NOT glass. Its a $100 phone, you get what you pay for in features but the build quality is pretty good.

Service : Activating the phone was great! The guy i talked to was easy to understand and very nice.

Once I did get it off and on again another bubble had appeared in the screen from where I pried it off.  I suppose I compromised the plastic.  This was not fixable.

Screen Protector #2: I re-cleaned the phone and proceeded with the written instructions (again). This time a bubble appeared that I could not scrap away with the supplied tool.  I could not see any evidence of lint or dust.  I peeled it off and as I did so something got on the sticky side.  I followed the instructions to rinse in warm water and let the screen air dry.

I ordered this unit because the other cradles were all too squared-off for my tastes, but there were no reviews at the time so I wondered about quality, etc... Upon getting the actual cradle my concerns were proven to be unfounded!

What you get is a nice cradle unit (with a small desktop footprint, for those who seek that), two micro-USB to USB cords, and a separate USB plug-in charging unit (unlike the picture above, which is a good thing in my book!) so you could easily use the cord from the unit and the OEM HTC plug-in unit if that's your thing.

My Evo fits into the cradle nicely (without a case - If you require a cradle that accepts a case this will probably NOT work for you as it is a very close fit) and the design of the base keeps everything solidly planted in an upright position. The finish is good, and the blue LED at the front of the unit is nowhere near as distracting as I feared that it might be! The second battery slot, which tucks the spare battery away discreetly behind the Evo, is a bit of a tight fit but it seems to work nicely too(It requires the second USB cord to be hooked to power as well, which is no big deal to me but a unified single-cord setup would have been even better...)

It's a flip case (book fashion) as demonstrated in the images.  It does not fold flat against the back when open.  It might after it gets well broken in but i don't plan on keeping it long enough to find out. The leather (it smells like leather) appears to be glued directly to the back of the plastic holder.  This adds an unnecessary ridge and additional thickness to the case.  It would have been better had they provided a recess in the plastic and attached the leather flush.

All buttons and charging port are accessible.  The thickness of the plastic makes the power and volume buttons not as easy to press.

As for the design of the physical device, the size and shape is very similar to iphone so it feels comfortable and almost perfect when held in your hand. I have not owned an iphone before, but I have held them.

I do wish the micro USB input was at the bottom of the phone, but the little door to keep dust out is definitely nice. Comparing this device to other smartphones I have owned, it seems that in most cases, the audio port is always next to the USB port and having the audio port at the top is a big plus for me.

The screen is very nice and so far, the pictures have been good. The microphone is poor for video recording, but nobody has complained about the sound during a conversation. Besides talking through the handset, I also use a bluetooth headset, which I already owned, and though I have not had a phone conversaton with any other mic'd headsets yet, but I have listened to music through other headphones, as well as the the stock accessory, which sounds more than decent, and the volume output is adequate.

The best software feature on this phone is Swype keyboard input system. It takes a bit to master Swype, but when combined with a small stylus, it is simply the fastest phone input method I have used yet. Not much else to say about the phone's software. It is Android and it can have a glitch every once in a while.

The dock is a simple yet elegant design that holds the phone at about a 65-70 degree angle which is perfect for viewing. The cable included, although only a USB cable and not a DC cable is still very nice, durable and will connect to any DC-USB plug. I picked up a few locally for quite cheap and plugged them in. The base is sturdy and the connection to the phone is snug but the phone does wobble a tad when the base is used. Considering this is a charging and docking base I don't see this as a major problem. My own phone sits nicely without any case or skin and my wife's phone which has a snap-on cover still fits well without any issue whatsoever. Another great feature of this affordable dock is that you can sit your phone on it in landscape mode since it offers extra room in front of the micro-usb connection for the phone.

One of the huge benefits over other units is that this one is more ""universal"" in design meaning you can turn the micro-usb connection around should you need to use it for a phone that has a port facing the opposite direction.

Pros:
Stylish
Sturdy
Stable
Samsung Galaxy SII can fit with or without a case attached
Phone sits nicely in portrait or landscape without any issue
Since the charge/dock unit uses a micro-usb you can pretty much use it with any other phone, not just a Samsung i9100 so this unit will come in handy when you upgrade to a new phone!

It's a shame because I have found their suction cup and their device holding assembly far superior to anything I've ever used. Their products main strength is the ability to easily seat and unseat a mobile device onto a windshield mount without concern for compatibility with the case you're using. My work around to the ball joint issue was to put a couple of drops of Gorilla glue in the ball joint assembly and adjust the device to the optimal viewing angle as it was mounted on the windshield. Naturally, this freezes the unit in place making it no longer adjustable, but it makes it very secure and sturdy. If you already have a mount that is too loose to stay in place while the glue dries, Cut some fabric off of an old 100% Polyester shirt (I used and old softball jersey) in 2"" x 2"" squares, Fold this fabric over the ball and press the ball into the ball joint.
Use the number of fabric squares necessary to tighten the assembly so it will hold your phone in place. Then remove the ball from the joint and put drops of Gorilla glue on the fabric layers and reassemble. Adjust the device as necessary for optimal viewing and give the assembly 30-45 minutes to dry. Place a cloth directly below the unit to catch any glue that drips.
Use scissors to trip any excess fabric away after the glue has dried.

-Gross distortions that anyone could pickout. If you are into quality music in the car environment, forget this device!

-NOT a headset solution for the iPod thorugh SKYPE!!! Still must plug in a MIC to the iPod.
-NOTE: This is probably a limitaion of SKYPEs APP and not a failing of either the iPod or the BLT370!!!! Maybe there is a better phone app out there for iPod??

-Annoying status LED most of the time. The feedback is good, but hella annoying at night indeed. Black tape!
-Short power lead for +12V (1"", no joke)

Very clear if the phone is in my shirt pocket, or on my table within 5 ft, but that's about as good as a wired headset. I was very surprised by this, since my phone is a Nokia Xpressmusic 5800 and I thought the two would get along really well
2. Ear bud coated with very hard rubber; not the most gentle on your ear canal
3. Single large ear bud; size cannot be adjusted
4. No volume adjustment on the headset; you need to adjust volume directly on the phone. Headset only has a single multifunction button (I had guessed there'd be at least 2 looking at images)

Summary: More convenient than a wired headset, but with about the same range. Can't complain for the price.","Mixed feelings, but its a keeper",1265760000,15.0,,

When the keys are pressed, its name is announced.  It's cute, highly readable and as easy to use as a cell phone can be.  Finally, there is the emergency sequence call SOS button on the back.

In practice, there are a few improvements to be made:
1.  Offer a flip-phone version.  The reason is that some seniors are unaccustomed to pressing an ""off hook"" and an ""on hook"" button; a flip phone has ""open to answer"", ""close to hangup"" intuitiveness.
2.  Allow option of ""auto pickup"" and ""auto hangup""; disabling voicemail.  Since this is primarily a senior alert device, a caller/caregiver should be able to remotely listen in to the person called e.g. by pressing a code at the voicemail announcement.  In addition, since many seniors have trouble remembering to press the ""hang up/red"" button, the phone should automatically reset when a signal is lost.

1.  Torchlight.  There is a slide switch on once side that is easy to miss and difficult for arthritic hands.

I purchased this in blue/purple lightning. I have had sooooooo many cases prior to this. You name it, Speck, iFrogz, Kiosks in the mall cases, Kate Spade, Carbon Fiber, etc..  This case is the best one I've ever had.

FIT: The fit is just perfect - it is SO snug and thin, yet easy to put on and off, but yet it doesn't fall off or slip off and it feels protective.  How they accomplished that I have no idea.  None of the buttons are crippled because of the case, and all of my plugs fit into the phone perfect.  The camera isn't affected.  The feel is perfect - soft yet sturdy.

STYLING: I am not a plane Jane type of girl, so the boldness of the blue/purple lightning is perfect for me.  I was wondering if it would be a little loud or if I would get sick of it but I honestly can't see that happening. If you are worried about the boldness the other colors don't seem too loud.  I have a black phone and there is still some transparency to the case.

PROTECTION:  Amazingly the material is squishy enough, yet not squishy (if that makes any sense) to the point where there's a slight bounce to it if it were to fall.  You would think that would make it look cheap though, but it doesn't.  The case is raised just enough in the front where if you drop it on it's face it would have protection, yet it's not that type of case that has a big ridge around the front.

FEEL:  I love the way it feels.  It's soft like when Speck first came out with the soft feel, yet hard enough to stay sturdy.

This is an amazing phone. It does work with At&t 3g if you are wondering, but I don't know about T-mobile.

Pros:
Screen- This phone comes with a four inch super amoled screen, which looks great. The colors are crisp, and blacks look like blacks. Blues look like blues, and reds look like reds. Colors look like they are supposed to be.

OS- I love android, and think that it is better than Ios, Windows mobile, and blackberry. The app market has tons of apps, so don't be fooled by people who say that the Iphone has more apps, because it has all of the apps that you need. It is clean and smooth. Right now it comes with android gingerbread 2.3.3, but you get an update to 2.3.6, and the Nexus s has been confirmed to get the ICS update, and won't be long from now.

Battery life- I charge my phone every night, but after using it for about 4 hours a day, using internet, texting, calling, and app usage, with auto brightness, I usually end up with about 60-70 percent of my battery left at night.

Data Speeds- About 30 minutes out of New York, I get speeds of about 1 Mbps down, and .1 Mbps up which is fine for 3g.

Cons:
The only cons that I found was that this phone doesn't have 4g or a dual core processor. I'm 12 years old, so I don't need any of that stuff.

Overall, I would definatly recommend this phone to anyone, especially since it will be getting the ICS update.",Amazing,1321920000,2.0,,

I couldn't resist giving the N8 a shot to see what advances Symbian 3 had made. All I can say is it hasn't come very far. When you are used to the blinding speed of advancement in the android space its hard to imagine how Nokia are going to stay relevant.

This is amazing piece of hardware, but how frustrating it is to be back on symbian. I don't even know where to start suffice to say that I am back on android after only a few days with N8. I was very disappointed as I had high hopes.

N8 Pro:
Excellent battery life
Best camera of any phone
Finally has threaded texting (as long as it took isn't a good sign for Nokia)

N8 cons:
Not many pros
Keyboard sucks
Browser sucks
Exchange client sucks
Still cant type direct in a text box
Limited widgets
Limited apps
Sluggish UI
No wifi tether
Smallish screen for size of device
Amoled screen isn't even close to vibrant

Well, I used have the HTC EVO 3D from Sprint. Which it was my first smartphone. I simply hated my EVO 3D, dropping calls... Keep rebooting all the time, and not built in great materials.

So, I canceled my plan with SPRINT (terrible signal in San Diego), and I decide that I needed to have a great phone for the next couple years.

Samsung Galaxy S3 seemed the right choice. I have to tell to you I have no regret about buying these handset for $699... Good point is unlocked... So you are free.

The S3 is fast with Exynos 4212 Quad (CPU Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A9) plus the great camera... Also, the GT-I9300 doesn't have bloatware from the carriers, which you can't uninstall but only if you root.

I have T-MOBILE now, valued plan. And I know I am getting EDGE 2G, which I was thinking if was a good call. SO contact the T-mobile customer Service. and I got really good news!!!

""T-Mobile's Network Modernization. New equipment will be installed in 400 GSM/HSPA+ sites by the end of June that will enable HSPA+ in the 1900 MHz band.

The reason that T-mobile are doing this only now, because At&T failed to buy T-mobile not being approved by the government. T-mobile wouldn't spend a penny... at that time they were going to use the At&t system.

So, now T-mobile doesn't want to stay behind by the rivals. Which is great. Which means T-Mobile will announce the IPHONE as well working on 1900 mhz band.

I know I could easily handle the issue through Amazon, but I thought I would try Samsung support to see what it is like. After two calls, 35 minutes and 7 different ""support"" people I was told the only option would be to return the entire mount, not just the defective charger, to Samsung, and only once they received it they would send me a new one.

This was a simple issue, where the first person who answered the phone should have been empowered to apologize and send a $5 replacement charger, but apparently Samsung prefers to frustrate customers rather than ""wow"" them. I have ordered a cheap OEM Motorola charger from Amazon to make up for Samsung's failure. I'm sure using this will void my warranty, but the warranty is useless so that's not really a loss is it. If this had been an Apple device I would have had the issue resolved in 5 minutes either in store or on the phone, Samsung on the other hand took me a frustrating 35 minutes before giving up and walking away with a bad taste in my mouth I now regret allowing myself to get locked into a two year contract on one of their devices, all for the sake of a cheap part.","Mount is okay, Samsung support is worse than useless",1335398400,3.0,,

If you don't get both pieces off, you will be left with a sticker on one side. Application was simple, and the screen protector looked barely there.

They are thick and look very protective, and there's absolutely no impact to touch sensitivity.  The surface seems pretty resistant to scratches (see below).

The bad:  Like all panels, it's hard to get them perfectly aligned the first time, and they are severe dust magnets.  I've applied my share, and this is no better or worse than any of them, except the thickness works against you trying to work out bubbles.  I ended up with about three little dust motes under the screen, which is pretty OK, I guess, and I have two more to try if it ever drives me nuts (which it will).  But short of a clean-room environment, it's tough to make them work right unless you get a good lay-in-place-and-slide-out backing (not a ""remove and place the protector on"" type backing like this one that leaves the protector exposed to dust in the air for a few seconds).

The ugly:  The included application accessories.  The cloth is a joke - I mean, seriously, don't even pull it out of its little bag, it releases lint.  I ran it over the screen and ended up with about 20 times more lint than I started with.  Fortunately, I have some GOOD microfiber cloth and I was able after some serious effort to work off all the lint that the included cloth left behind.

And the little bubble scraper is, if anything, worse.  Most of them come with a little cloth lining on one end to protect the screen protector, this one had very sharp edges and was too bendy to really work well for moving bubbles.  I made it work, but it was a lot more work than it should have been.  In its partial defense, it's tough to get bubbles out of a thick protector like this one, and all three dust mites were the !@#$@#$ blue fabric of the original dust cloth that hadn't settled before I took off the protective lining, so it was starting at a severe disadvantage.

Back to the surface.  I worked out most of the bubbles and took off the top surface protector, then had to re-work a bubble that was hidden under the pull tab of the surface protector.  Despite the pressure I had to put on and the scratchiness of the nasty plastic spreader included, the screen protector showed no signs of damage.

So color me impressed with the actual screen protectors, especially at the very affordable price, but I would have gladly paid an extra buck to get a real lint-free microfober cloth and not the junky fuzzy lint-generator included, and a proper bubble squeegee.  I'd buy again, but I wish the company cared as much about applying them as they do about the actual protectors - they've got a top-notch product ruined by the cheap extras that could have been made GREAT for a few pennies more.",OK.

After some research, I choose this case, and I couldn't be happier. I would go as far to say its the best case I've ever owned for any phone. It's tough enough to feel confident with, and it has a nice texture to it that allows good grip but won't get stuck in your pocket. The reason I choose TPU or ""soft cases"" is that they don't break after a slight mishap and I feel as though they offer better impact protection. They also don't get scratched, nor do they scratch the surface you place them on.

The case does add some thickness and weight to your thin and light phone, but its a compromise I'm willing to make if it means I can protect my investment. All the holes are perfect for the Skyrocket, and the lip on the front means I can put the phone down face first without fear of scratches or damage. It plays nice with all my accessories too, even my large headphone jacks. There is a cut out for the power button, which is good because the recess prevents it from accidentally getting pressed. The rocker switch for the volume buttons are bumps in the case, which gets rid of the tactile feedback, and the raised bumps means the buttons are occasionally hit by accident. It doesn't really bother me though.

The base of this unit has great suction, that is, as long as the suction cup is clean.  Get a little dust or dirt on it and bye bye suction.  It does clean easily with water, if you happen to have that available when you need it or before hand.  A good tip is to always remember to wipe the surface clean if you think it shows any sign of dust or dirt.

Now this is where the unit fails in my opinion.  You get the unit mounted nice and securely, you put the phone in the clamp, usually takes two hands, and then your try to position the phone how you want.  Wrong!  There is not enough flexibility of movement to do this.  You have to keep unsuctioning the base and readjusting until you find a position that works for you.  I like to be able to put my phone in vertical or horizontal position depending on what's displaying on my phone.  I did finally find a position that works fairly well, but I'm almost afraid to remove it to use in my other vehicle.

The phone does seems to stay in the clamp pretty well, but you need two hands to install it.  I did have one case where the phone did fall out when in a vertical position.  Not sure if I had it clamped in good enough or not.

Pros:  Good suction when clean

Cons: Not enough flexibility in movement of the phone to make it a joy to use.

 My concern was how would I transfer photos from the camera's SD card to the tablet?

 Well, this cable does the trick if your camera has PictBridge (PTP) capability. If it does, just use the USB cable that came with your camera, plug it into this cable, turn the camera on and with Android v3.2.1, the Gallery opens and you can start an Import dialog. With my tablet, I moved nearly a Gigabyte of images from camera to tablet in a bit more than 2 minutes.

 One precaution: adjust your screen to stay active for at least the time you expect the transfer to take or you can interrupt the transfer. I just set it for 30 minutes when I am about to transfer and then return it to my normal setting.

 I chose this over the Motorola because of the 90-degree connector. In the final analysis, I don't think it really makes a difference.

 For my needs, transferring photos from camera to tablet, this cable works perfectly and I am satisfied.

My previous vehicle dock had too many adjustable angles that made setup more frustrating than it needed to be. This has a simple ball and socket design that permits plenty of angles for any setup.  It is also nice that the charging cord plugs into the dock itself instead of directly into the phone. Now you don't have to fiddle with the cord each and every time you place or remove the phone.

As per previous versions, the phone detects the dock on insert - along with the SMART Actions app, you have a wide range of control over what happens then (volume adjustments, gps on, wifi off, screen up, auto-reply texts, etc, etc). Nice accessory that adds a good amount of functionality specific to driving - a little expensive on its own, but a great deal when you look at the price of stand alone 5 inch GPS units.

Does not come with a charger (nice, since I already have several) but does come with a head-phone to head-phone cable so you can plug into some car stereos directly. Also has setup for both windshield and dashboard mounting.

Comes with custom fit pieces that allow for snug fit on both the RAZR HD and RAZR MAXX HD including with or without a protective case. That's right, you can have a protective case on the larger MAXX and it will still fit in this dock.

Update 12/3/12: I finally received the Otterbox Commuter after a terrible experience with Otterbox - I'll save that for a different review. The case DOES NOT quite fit in the dock as intended. However, the phone does slide in nicely with only the inner soft skin from the Otterbox case. This would indicate that less robust cases and skins would actually work.

I use it with my Zune and my Samsung Galaxy S Captivate phone.  They are on the right track for how to hold these things down, but they sorta failed in the final implementation.  Much to the credit of the designers, the basic concept is sort of a cage that closes on the device.  The only problem is that the closing mechanism is basically a rubber band. This approach is cheap, but dumb.  The force a rubber band applies is a function of how much it is distorted.  So something smaller gets less force and bounces the heck right out of the mount like my Zune did three times on medium bumps.  Fortunately it survived, but now I only use the thing with a supplemental Velcro strap to hold my device in.  If they had only used a ratchet/release mechanism like on handcuffs, this would be the bomb.  Everything else about it is great.  It's light, sleek, and functionally correct.  The cage which closes on the device does have a slightly too large lip on the phone face side, so that the bottom buttons on my captivate are barely accessible, but with a very directed finger press I can get the home row buttons to work.  With just a little more thought and effort this could be the best device holder I have found yet.  It's only the second one I have purchased and tried, but I have studied at least two dozen.

OK, I am not that hairy a guy, but these gloves snag the hair off my arms.  It's sort of annoying, but whatever, it isn't that bad.  Also, my Mazda RX-8 has a leather steering wheel, and is one of the more harder steering cars on the street.  The gloves are pretty slippery, so you have to make sure you have a firm grip on your wheel.  Owners of BMW's may have a really hard time with these gloves on...lol.  I love cars with tough steering, and these gloves make it a challenge to drive.  Again - who cares?  It's still not that big a deal.

WHAT IS A BIG DEAL - is three days after purchasing these gloves, fibers are hanging from everywhere, the tips feel like they are going to fall apart, and I can feel wind passing through them.  What a crock.  I have bought some cheap gloves at a ""99 cent and up"" store for $2.99 and they lasted longer than these.

Save your money - these gloves are absolutely not worth it unless you plan to wear them, not use your hands for anything, and take them off right away.

I wish I could send them back, but there is no way that Amazon would believe that these were damaged from normal use.  I'll probably end up throwing them out in another 2 weeks or so.",If you have money to waste...,1356220800,14.0,,

Even when applied properly (no bubbles) it comes off on the corners when I put the phone into D3O case because protector edge snap over the case edge (happen to have identical size) lifting it up. Do not buy unless you plan to use a phone ""naked"".

11/02/2011 update
I gave myself one more try today before returning this protector to get a refund. I clipped this bubbled corner with sharp scissors trying to keep dirt and dust away. It took several gentle thin cuts along the corner to make a bubble disappear. Amazingly after this my D3O case does not interfere with Realook anymore. And the protector finally ""disappeared"" from the view as it should seamlessly blending with the phone screen.

It looks like it worked and it is going to stay on my SGSII for good.

If only Realook made these corners right from the beginning leaving bit more space to save a hassle during its application.

Charged for about 5 minutes, and I had to charge the extended battery first to get it to charge the phone. Got a 2nd one, seems to be working, although the instructions say the blue LED's are suppose to turn on when connecting it to the phone..that doesn't happen. Have to press and hold the power button for about 3 seconds and it starts charging. This time it holds the charge but battery life is horrible even after charging the extended battery for 3-4 hours. I started using it when the phone was at 50% and barely got 90% before it died. You would think a battery that's bigger than the size of the phone's battery would actually hold a charge for a day or at least get a full charge..I didn't even get half of a charge. Was really disappointed, it's a nice looking case, just doesn't work right at all and it's the only case with a built in charger that I could find for the razr.

The only problem I have had is that the voice control and text message reading works when it wants to (although I didn't read how to set it up lol)  It will read the number that is calling and prompt you to say ""answer"" to answer or something else not to answer, which works great when driving.

I'm not finding the same flaws other reviewers found.  Case is sturdy with a textured grip (not tacky), and I've used the stand for a month now with no sign of weakness.  It also fit into my existing holster (that I transferred from my iPhone 3G), so that's even MORE savings!

The stand props the phone at ideal angles for viewing vertically or horizontally when sitting at a desk/table.  It can even be used on a tabletop from a standing position for speech notes. It's sturdy enough to use the touch screen without the need to hold onto the phone.  It also plugs in to my desktop charging stand with ease.

All in all, for nine bucks, it is a heck of a deal.  I added on the underwater camera case for fourteen more bucks, and that was also an excellent purchase (not sure if will always be available as a combo.)

I didn't know if I'd experience issues between ""LR927"" and ""SR927"" but I guess it's just the materials in the battery and a very slightly different voltage. (1.55V for SR (silver oxide) and 1.5 for LR (alkaline))  These worked out perfect.  The SR batteries are also said to have a greater capacity and a more constant voltage as its life diminishes - so they should work for quite a bit longer while also staying bright longer.",perfect,1324598400,32.0,,

All you have to do is insert the adapter into your iphone/ipod touch/ipad and it will ask if you want to download and install the software from the app store. After installing, I added my TV which is Visio, then named the button and done! No codes to input, no training the remote (unless you want to). It worked with 2 tv's, RCA audio reciever, Visio BluRay player, xbox 360 and PS2. All without codes. Just pick what it is, what brand it is, and name the button.

The macros make it that much better. I programmed one macro button to turn on the TV, Audio Receiver, and Xbox.
