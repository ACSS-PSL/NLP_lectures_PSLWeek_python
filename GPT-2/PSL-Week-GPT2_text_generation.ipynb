Some are a little loose or rubbery, but not a big deal.  I really like the texture of this case, especially for those of us who love the feel of a protective case.\n","\n","I don't want to purchase one for the wallet, hands, etc.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"I was looking for a compact, high quality iPhone case for the Evo 4S and found the Casecell.com website a little on the disappointing location of \"\"7800\"\" while it was in use. While walking through their office, I noticed them had a lot of space for the ear flap.  So I decided to try and find a location for it.\n","\n","This is my attempt at finding a place that is more convenient for me to use the iPhone since it has a larger area of available space for the flap.  It feels much more secure and protects the iPhone as it is a larger device.\n","\n","I found this location pretty easy!  The place is easily access-able and easy to access in a matter of minutes while in it's own parking spot.  The iPhone feels somewhat solid and not slippery while on it's case.  Overall, this is very secure.\n","\n","On one hand I am a little reluctant to move on concrete since there is a tendency at the base of the concrete to slip on top of a person or something.  I don't like that.  Some concrete has a tendency to create a tight fitting grip on a chair while others I have never seen. Also, the place is less than 1/4 mile from the area I originally intended for my iPhone, so it makes it easy to get in and out of a car accident-prone area without much hassle.\n","\n","There are a few additional utilities that you can install into the iPhone (see pics in my review) but none of these are sufficient to protect the iPhone from people who try to throw it out of their car during a drop or scrape. It would have been awesome if all the utilities or even all of them were installed in the proper spots.  In fact, if it were a case that my brother took me to see, I would say it is a 5 star listing.\n","\n","One area of concern was the fact that the iPhone sits flat on a hard surface.  So my brother put a few small ball joints into the case to allow the iPhone to lay flat on concrete instead of the hard plastic I was using.  Some of the joints can also be used to hold the iPhone in place or on your pocket without any problem, but be careful about that.\n","\n","One advantage of this case over most of the other cases I have been using is that it doesn't collect dust while I am using a hair dryer.  So while it might not be a big deal, it is a good deal when you get it.\n","\n","I would have been thrilled with the size for an Evo 4S, but I am, in fact, liking how I have had a larger/naked phone which I have kept for my wife.  We both work in the heating and air conditioning department so it is not that big of a deal.\n","\n","The fact that they have this in such a small package is nice as well.  I am thinking they will have to drop the unit as a result of my decision.  I would really like the case as a family case but I don't have anywhere near the space I am willing to invest in an Evo.  It may be worth the space, but it's kind of small right now in my budget.\n","\n","The case that I received gives the phone its natural 1 inch screen facing up so that I can use my iPhone 4 with the case in landscape or portrait mode (assuming it can see the original photo)\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"I bought this to repair the defective Apple Car Touch because of the size of the screen protector. I found that the screen protector on the original Iphone was too big, so me and my husband started adding screen covers when we used a standard screen protector - but the iPhone 4 itself is too small so we decided to go up a bit higher. The screen protector we started with is now 8.5mm thick and is just barely covering the entire screen area. The only help I can get for the iPhone is one word - I use the correct pronunciation and use -    -   the standard phone pronunciation. When we tried the screen protector, it was only about 2\", but then we found the actual screen protector and decided to order one to replace the screen protector we received in September. So far there seems to be no cheaper one that is just identical - a free upgrade from the $9.99 you pay for the iPhone 5.\n","\n","The screen and the screen protector are both great products to have handy when on the go.

The design is very sleek and not bulky. It is very light. It does not attract much attention and can provide a good amount of protection. I feel that the case is quite well designed since there are many \"\"lip\"\" cases available to the net which keeps the case from getting scratched up.\n","\n","If you are looking for a case that will not break the sleek lines of Android, then this case will impress you. It will take a bit of getting used to, but once you get used to it you will not be disappointed. The design is very classy and not bulky, but handsfree dials with a real \"\"slip\"\" is not nearly as elegant as a case that does not touch the phone. The 3.5 mm jack is located on the bottom of the phone so you will not have to worry about it scratching the phone. The volume is just right. No \"\"slip\"\" that will happen if you mess it up.\n","\n","The siliconey/veil of the case is pretty slick in comparison to the slick plastic of the iPhone, so the \"\"slip\"\" is not that big of a deal. It is very slick and smooth in comparison to the slippery/meat-colored plastic that appears on the iPhone's screen. The \"\"lip\"\" case is designed to make the phone look slick so the phone doesn't slip out of the case once you put it on.\n","\n","Overall, I would put this case at the very top of my phone's priority list, as I have the very best of both worlds: a sleek, attractive, and simple phone. I would recommend this case to anyone with a Samsung S.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"I'm a 24 h samsung user and my only requirement was to have a compatible samsung device to use with my SGSII.

I find the soft brushed plastic to be very handy for me, as well.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,I had been very careful with my iPhone 4s due to paranoid phone wifes but I just decided to order this case and it is amazing for the price the best quality is the gel case with the thick red and white stripes it fits perfect perfect and I must say it does everything I need it to. This case fits the iphone just great its super easy to insert and release my sony hands to the phone even tho I had some reservations about its not falling out more like a little piece of plastic and then slide out like a credit card to let my samsung sppd work its its like the case did its job. I highly recommend this case with sony and vcore at their best. I highly recommend this sony phone with 3g aswell its on nokia at their site its a great value and I highly recomend this item and its gel make or razc btw its a great deal less expensive than the generic just my personal opinion but this goes without saying its great with the dark plaid and black plaid just something to keep in mind if you are considering this case then I would recomend this little powerhouse its a must have!.

When you take the battery out it will automatically turn off when you turn your phone on again but this feature is useless since the battery that it will recharge automatically on should only last two days. If I charge a battery the whole day it will recharge automatically on 2 days but I can't go wrong if I have one for only one day. My cell phone constantly drops about 20% which is why I have a habit of taking them to the doctor. This feature is only useful for Samsung Fit 2Gs which use the Samsung ATT2G. If I were to take one for my wife it would be able to recharge 2Gs in 1 trip so it is a big deal. The price is also good so I would recommend it. I found it $20 more when I dropped it at a bar and put the Nokia E71 into the cradle. It works perfectly and goes on and off like magic.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"The phone is an OEM specification, so it is actually an Android device. However, it has a few preinstalled apps installed which allow it to work better without needing a rooted app.\n","I highly recommend this phone.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"I bought this item in a TPU case for other people using SGSII. It fits perfectly and the screen protector is very good too. It's much smaller than the TPU case and it isn't noticeable when the phone is mounted to the case. It may cause issues with camera video, but for the camera video, it works great. Live wallpaper doesn't bother me as I have other problems with deflating live wallpaper. And the LED indicator doesn't bother anyone except me just because I have a hard time letting the phone see the whole red and green color gamut. I have a hard time seeing the entire spectrum when I'm taking photos. That's why I'm finding it very frustrating. I bought a different screen protector asap for the same price and it did work quite well.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"I love this cover after reading all of the positive reviews. I didn't expect much since I only used the stand a few times but I love the design and color. I actually tried out a black background for the cover but that would be sweet, but I'm out of luck with my home state and had to go to a dark red/red/blue/white state.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"Love it, love the idea, love the color.  But the reason I didn't give this 3 stars is because I wasn't sure if the 3 piece would hold up.  It did, and the only thing really holding it up is its plastic \"\"lip\"\" which would help it lift up when I'm trying to open and close my eyes.  Bottom line is I love the product and will recommend it to anyone.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"I got these so I could practice hitting them up and keeping my eye on the ball.  This is a tight fit, especially with the zip ties going around the front.  I took it off over my shoulder and put on cradles too, so I have a lot of room to grip the sides of the phone if needed.  The case looks awesome on the phone (very high regard to @jaredwinchester!) My fiance and I are going to purchase another of these tight cases. I recommend this case to anyone who is thinking of getting one.\",<|endoftext|>\n","<|start|>,\"These are terrible! Already had $29 shipped so I ran out of bricks; instead I bought some slowly building blocks and threw them in the trash.

There's almost a 3D quality to the phone, and it's light weight. If you look closely, you'll find a bracket placed just in front of the case for charging the battery. The design is actually simpler than the Nexus S, in that it's no longer needed to pivot the phone to use the keyboard, and the position of the buttons isn't altered - it just sits at the keyboard pivot point.\n","\n","The display on the phone is awesome; bright and bright! The Pen & Swype interface is as responsive and smooth as its real app-name brother, AT&T. Texting is crisp and easy - just tap the input button, and the text area is then rechecked - with a few little settings you can turn to top-notch apps such as the weather, radio, sports, or a complete suite of weather functions.\n","\n","The phone's T-Mobile Web2SD storage capacity is limited, as is the removable battery. I ran out of cells for the device, so I carefully packed the whole thing (doing it all with two hands), and attached it to a heavy-duty power socket at home. As a backup, I placed the phone into its spot on the wall behind my sink, so it would drain within 2-3 days.\n","\n","It's now about 2-3 days without holding the phone in/out of the dock, and I'm left holding/dismissing the phone in the dock. That was the beauty of the iTorch, that as soon as you lose a cell phone battery, you can plug it back in. So now I find myself re-winding the entire time I wasted it in my backpack. That's what I meant when I said I wouldn't warranty it, but it's worth it to have the ability to hold/dismiss your phone in the dock.\n","\n","So in the end, I'll make the effort to a cell phone-watcher that I contacted said \"\"Hey, you have to put the whole thing back\"\",\",\"which apparently it doesn't say either. So far, the results have been good. I haven't lost the battery,, nor have I had the charger stop working, so as long as the phone is still working, I can continue to look at the iTorch. It doesn't take long. And I've been able to locate the iTorch near by many times within 5-6 feet of it. (Which is pretty near!) So I may just make the purchase happen, though I wouldn't 100% tell until I actually use the phone. \"\" [After holding the phone for about 1 1/2 minutes, the touch-tone 'charger' logo appears on the product screen]\n","\n","Oh, and iTorch-specific words...\n","\n","-Sturdy\n","-Convenient\n","\n","-Acts like one...It functions like one.\n","\n","I could have gone for the RAZR V3, but I also have several other music player models (earlier Motorola phones were not compatible due to the small size of the iPhone). Hence, my preference for the RAZR V3. It's very similar in design to the Otterbox and it's quite affordable. Also, although the ear-candy is metal, there's no plastic on the RAZR that slides in to prevent your finger from hitting the n on the button, you have to buy a different kind to mount to. It's made of boron, but surprisingly it feels nearly smooth (slippery) and has a rubber texture on the inner side. Its bass output is comparable to that of an Otterbox.\n","\n","The front of the phone has a glass screen and uses a kindle to charge and sync the battery. The rear camera hole is open and functions like a normal phone does. It's very similar to the rear camera hole on earlier Motorola phones. The one feature that differs about the RAZR from the Otterbox is that it has a built-in wall charger for charging the phone directly into the phone. However, if you intend to charge the phone from your computer, you'll have to get a wall adapter to charge the USB port on the RAZR. That's not an issue as the phone will charge from either of those if you leave it plugged in the car.\n","\n","The included micro-USB cable works with most USB-powered devices. I find the usb-plug about 40% longer than the original one and 80% longer than if I used the included cable. That seems to be the limit of what I can get from the Motorola line of phones.\n","\n","The charger is about the same size as the original one and about the same size as the Droid Razr. In fact, the two are quite similar when designed, so this is not a problem, but I think it's fair to say that its performance\n","\n","[810 | 1895.08] loss=0.28 avg=1.49\n","[820 | 1917.93] loss=0.35
